comedy group monty python graham chapman john cleese terry gilliam eric idle terry jones and michael palin it was directed by jones the film tells the story of brian cohen played by chapman a young jewishroman man who is born on the same day asand next door tojesus and is subsequently mistaken for the messiah\\nfollowing the withdrawal of funding by emi films just days before production was scheduled to begin longtime monty python fan and former member of the beatles george harrison arranged financing for life of brian through the formation of his company handmade films\\nthe films themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups thirtynine local authorities in the united kingdom either imposed an outright ban or imposed an x 18 years certificate some countries including ireland and norway banned its showing and in a few of these such as italy bans lasted decades the filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film with posters in sweden reading so funny it was banned in norway\\nthe film was a box office success the fourthhighestgrossing film in the united kingdom in 1979 and highest grossing of any british film in the united states that year it has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks and it later received a 95 certified fresh rating on rotten tomatoes with the consensus one of the more cuttingedge films of the 1970s this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical in a 2006 channel 4 poll life of brian was ranked first on their list of the 50 greatest comedy films\\nplot\\nbrian cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which jesus is born which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future king of the jews brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing roman occupation of judea while listening to jesuss sermon on the mount brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel judith his desire for her and hatred of the romans further exaggerated by his mother revealing brian himself is halfroman inspire him to join the peoples front of judea pfj one of many fractious and bickering independence movements which spend more time fighting each other than they do the romans\\nbrian participates in an abortive attempt by the pfj to kidnap the wife of roman governor pontius pilate but is captured by the palace guards escaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over pilates speech impediment brian winds up trying to blend in among prophets preaching in a busy plaza repeating fragments of jesus sermons he stops his sermon midsentence when some roman soldiers depart leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more brian grows frantic when people start following him and declare him to be the messiah after spending a night in bed with judith brian discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mothers house her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed so she consents to brian addressing them he urges them to think for themselves but they parrot his words as doctrine\\nthe pfj seeks to exploit brians celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures brian sneaks out the back only to be captured by the romans and is sentenced to crucifixion in celebration of passover a crowd has assembled outside the palace of pilate who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice the crowd shouts out names containing the letter r mocking pilates rhotacistic speech impediment eventually judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of brian which the crowd echoes and pilate agrees to welease bwian\\nhis order is eventually relayed to the guards but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film spartacus various crucified people all claim to be brian so they can be freed and the wrong man is released other opportunities for a reprieve for brian are denied as the pfj and then judith praise his martyrdom while his mother expresses regret for having raised him hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the judean peoples front charges and prompts the roman soldiers to flee however the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest condemned to a slow and painful death brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers who cheerfully sing always look on the bright side of life\\ncast\\nseveral characters remained unnamed during the film but do have names that are used in the soundtrack album track listing and elsewhere there is no mention in the film that eric idles evercheerful joker is called mr cheeky or that the roman guard played by michael palin is named nisus wettus\\nspike milligan plays a prophet ignored because his acolytes are chasing after brian by coincidence milligan was visiting his old world war ii battlefields in tunisia where the film was being made the pythons were alerted to this one morning and he was promptly included in the scene being filmed he disappeared in the afternoon before he could be included in any of the closeup or publicity shots for the film\\nproduction\\npreproduction\\nthere are various stories about the origins of life of brian shortly after the release of monty python and the holy grail 1975 eric idle flippantly suggested that the title of the pythons forthcoming feature would be jesus christ lust for glory a play on the uk title for the 1970 american film patton this was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration however they shared a distrust of organised religion and after witnessing the critically acclaimed holy grails enormous financial turnover confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the new testament era in the same way that holy grail had lampooned arthurian legend all they needed was an idea for a plot eric idle and terry gilliam while promoting holy grail in amsterdam had come up with a sketch in which jesus cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly however after an early brainstorming stage and despite being nonbelievers they agreed that jesus was definitely a good guy and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings hes not particularly funny what hes saying isnt mockable its very decent stuff said idle later after settling on the name brian for their new protagonist one idea considered was that of the 13th disciple the focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the messiah but had no desire to be followed as such\\nwriting\\nthe first draft of the screenplay provisionally titled the gospel according to st brian was ready by christmas 1976 the final preproduction draft was ready in january 1978 following a concentrated twoweek writing and waterskiing period in barbados the film would not have been made without python fan beatle george harrison who set up handmade films to help fund it at a cost of 3\\xa0million harrison put up the money for it as he wanted to see the movielater described by terry jones as the worlds most expensive cinema ticket\\nthe original backersemi films and particularly bernard delfonthad been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter the very last words in the film are i said to him bernie theyll never make their money back on this one teasing delfont for his lack of faith in the project terry gilliam later said they pulled out on the thursday the crew was supposed to be leaving on the saturday disastrous it was because they read the script  finally as a reward for his help harrison appears in a cameo appearance as mr papadopoulos owner of the mount who briefly shakes hands with brian in a crowd scene at 109 in the film his one word of dialogue a cheery but out of place scouse ullo had to be dubbed in later by michael palin\\nfilming\\nterry jones was solely responsible for directing having amicably agreed with gilliam who codirected holy grail to do so with gilliam concentrating on the look of the film holy grails production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera gilliam again contributed two animated sequences one being the opening credits and took charge of set design however this did not put an absolute end to their feuding on the dvd commentary gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular the main hall of pilates fortress which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the romans had converted by dumping their structural artefacts such as marble floors and columns on top he reveals his consternation at jones for not paying enough attention to it in the cinematography gilliam also worked on the matte paintings useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a starscape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti perhaps the most significant contribution from gilliam was the scene in which brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war this was done in camera using a handbuilt model starship and miniature pyrotechnics gilliam recounted in an interview\\nwell we didnt know what to do with brian he got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow so i said ok spaceship for that that was purely it it was funny because this was at the time when star wars had just come out i remember meeting george lucas at the baggage roundabout in the san francisco airport and i said this was my chance to do a mini star wars episode\\nthe film was shot on location in monastir tunisia which allowed the production to reuse sets from franco zeffirellis jesus of nazareth 1977 the tunisian shoot was documented by iain johnstone for his bbc film the pythons many locals were employed as extras on life of brian director jones noted they were all very knowing because theyd all worked for franco zeffirelli on jesus of nazareth so i had these elderly tunisians telling me well mr zeffirelli wouldnt have done it like that you know further location shooting also took place in tunisia at sousse jerusalem outer walls and gateway carthage roman theatre and matmata sermon on the mount and crucifixion\\ngraham chapman suffering from alcoholism was so determined to play the lead role  at one point coveted by cleese  that he dried out in time for filming so much so that he also acted as the onset doctor\\nrough cut and prescreenings\\nfollowing shooting between 16 september and 12 november 1978 a twohour rough cut of the film was put together for its first private showing in january 1979 over the next few months life of brian was reedited and rescreened a number of times for different preview audiences losing a number of entire filmed sequences\\nediting\\na number of scenes were cut during the editing process five deleted scenes a total of 13 minutes including the controversial otto were first made available in 1997 on the criterion collection laserdisc an unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought handmade films however a number of them of varying quality were shown the following year on the paramount comedy channel in the uk the scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding jesuss birth which would have been at the very start of the film a segment showing the attempted kidnap of pilates wife a large woman played by john case whose escape results in a fistfight a scene introducing hardline zionist otto leader of the judean peoples front played by eric idle and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard and a brief scene in which judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help the shepherds scene has badly distorted sound and the kidnap scene has poor colour quality the same scenes that were on the criterion laserdisc can now be found on the criterion collection dvd\\nthe most controversial cuts were the scenes involving otto initially a recurring character who had a thin adolf hitler moustache and spoke with a german accent shouting accusations of racial impurity at judeans who were conceived as brian was when their mothers were raped by roman centurions as well as other nazi phrases the logo of the judean peoples front designed by terry gilliam was a star of david with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika most familiar in the west as the symbol of the antisemitic nazi movement the rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches and wore a spike on their helmets similar to those on imperial german helmets the official reason for the cutting was that ottos dialogue slowed down the narrative however gilliam writing in the pythons autobiography by the pythons said he thought it should have stayed saying listen weve alienated the christians lets get the jews now idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character its essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid zionism suggesting its rather akin to nazism which is a bit strong to take but certainly a point of view michael palins personal journal entries from the period when various edits of brian were being testscreened consistently reference the pythons and filmmakers concerns that the otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film however oxford brookes university historian david nash says the removal of the scene represented a form of selfcensorship and the otto sequence which involved a character representative of extreme forms of zionism was cut in the interests of smoothing the way for the films distribution in america\\nthe only scene with otto that remains in the film is during the crucifixion sequence otto arrives with his crack suicide squad sending the roman soldiers fleeing in terror instead of doing anything useful they attack by committing mass suicide in front of the cross zat showed em huh says the dying otto to which brian despondently replies you silly sods ending brians hope of rescue they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of always look on the bright side of life when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music terry jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to continuity reasons as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene he acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing\\nottos scenes and those with pilates wife were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers and so they can be found in the published version of the script also present is a scene where after brian has led the fifth legion to the headquarters of the peoples front of judea reg john cleese says you cunt you stupid birdbrained flatheaded the profanity was overdubbed to you klutz before the film was released cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the profanity would get in the way of the comedy\\nan early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in monty python the case against by robert hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an english public school much of this material was first printed in the monty pythons the life of brian  monty python scrapbook that accompanied the original script publication of the life of brian and then subsequently reused the song all things dull and ugly and the parody scripture reading martyrdom of st victor were performed on monty pythons contractual obligation album 1980 the idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in monty pythons the meaning of life 1983 a sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased the hastily cobbled together for a fast buck album 1981\\nsoundtrack\\nan album was also released by monty python in 1979 in conjunction with the film in addition to the brian song and always look on the bright side of life it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by eric idle and graham chapman the album opens with a brief rendition of hava nagila on scottish bagpipes a cd version was released in 1997\\nan album of the songs sung in monty pythons life of brian was released on the disky label always look on the bright side of life was later rereleased with great success after being sung by british football fans its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the falklands war when sailors aboard the destroyer hms sheffield severely damaged in an argentinean exocet missile attack on 4 may started singing it while awaiting rescue many people have come to see the song as a lifeaffirming ode to optimism one of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of manchesters bid to host the 2000 olympic games just after they were awarded to sydney idle later performed the song as part of the 2012 summer olympics closing ceremony always look on the bright side of life is also featured in eric idles spamalot a broadway musical based upon monty python and the holy grail and was sung by the rest of the monty python group at graham chapmans memorial service and at the monty python live at aspen special the song is a staple at iron maiden concerts where the recording is played after the final encore\\nrelease\\nfor the original british and australian releases a spoof travelogue narrated by john cleese away from it all was shown before the film itself it consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from cleese for instance a shot of bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment hard to believe isnt it that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of western civilisation as we know it communist bulgaria being a member of the warsaw pact at the time not only was this a spoof of travelogues per se it was a protest against the then common practice in britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature\\nlife of brian opened on 17 august 1979 in five north american theatres and grossed us140034 28007 per screen in its opening weekend its total gross was 19398164 it was the highest grossing british film in north america that year released on 8 november 1979 in the uk the film was the fourth highestgrossing film in britain in 1979 in london it opened at the plaza cinema and grossed 40470 in its opening week\\non 30 april 2004 life of brian was rereleased on five north american screens to cash in as terry jones put it on the box office success of mel gibsons the passion of the christ it grossed 26376 5275 per screen in its opening weekend it ran until october 2004 playing at 28 screens at its widest point eventually grossing 646124 during its rerelease by comparison a rerelease of monty python and the holy grail had earned 18 million three years earlier a dvd of the film was also released that year\\nreception\\nreviews from critics were mostly positive on the films release movie historian leonard maltin reported that this will probably offend every creed and denomination equally but it shouldnt the funniest and most sustained feature from britains bad boys vincent canby of the new york times called the film the foulestspoken biblical epic ever made as well as the besthumoreda nonstop orgy of assaults not on anyones virtue but on the funny bone it makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed roger ebert gave the film three stars out of four writing whats endearing about the pythons is their good cheer their irreverence their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities gene siskel of the chicago tribune gave the film three and a half stars calling it a gentle but very funny parody of the life of jesus as well as of biblical movies kevin thomas of the los angeles times declared even those of us who find monty python too hitandmiss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity clyde jeavons of the monthly film bulletin wrote that the script was occasionally overraucous and crude but found the second half of the film cumulatively hilarious with a splendidly tasteless finale which even mel brooks might envy gary arnold of the washington post had a negative opinion of the film writing that it was a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that brian is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit if only it were one might find it easier to keep from nodding off\\nover time life of brian has regularly been cited as a significant contender for the title greatest comedy film of all time and has been named as such in polls conducted by total film magazine in 2000 the british tv network channel 4 where it topped the poll in the 50 greatest comedy films and the guardian in 2007 rotten tomatoes lists it as one of the best reviewed comedies with a 95 approval rating from 61 published reviews a 2011 poll by time out magazine ranked it as the third greatest comedy film ever made behind airplane and this is spinal tap\\nthe bfi declared life of brian to be the 28th best british film of all time in their equivalent of the original afis 100 years100 movies list it was the seventh highest ranking comedy on this list four of the better placed efforts were classic ealing films another channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time the only comedy that came higher was billy wilders some like it hot which was ranked 5th in 2016 empire magazine ranked life of brian 2nd in their list of the 100 best british films with only david leans lawrence of arabia ranking higher\\nvarious polls have voted the line hes not the messiah hes a very naughty boy spoken by brians mother mandy to the crowd assembled outside her house to be the funniest in film history other famous lines from the film have featured in polls such as what have the romans ever done for us and im brian and sos my wife\\nblasphemy accusations\\ninitial criticism\\nrichard webster comments in a brief history of blasphemy 1990 that internalised censorship played a significant role in the handling of monty pythons life of brian in his view as a satire on religion this film might well be considered a rather slight production as blasphemy it was even in its original version extremely mild yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety in some quarters of the establishment about the offence it might cause as a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made perhaps more importantly still the film was shunned by the bbc and itv who declined to show it for fear of offending christians in the uk once again a blasphemy was restrained  or its circulation effectively curtailed  not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law on its initial release in the uk the film was banned by several town councils  some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries or had not even seen the film a member of harrogate council one of those that banned the film revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the nationwide festival of light a grouping with an evangelical christian base of which they knew nothing\\nin new york the films release in the us preceded british distribution screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns nuns with banners observed michael palin it was also banned for eight years in ireland and for a year in norway it was marketed in sweden as the film so funny that it was banned in norway during the films theatrical run in finland a text explaining that the film was a parody of hollywood historical epics was added to the opening credits\\nin the uk mary whitehouse and other traditionalist christians pamphleteered and picketed locations where the local cinema was screening the film a campaign that was felt to have boosted publicity leaflets arguing against the films representation of the new testament for example suggesting that the wise men would not have approached the wrong stable as they do in the opening of the film were documented in robert hewisons book monty python the case against\\ncrucifixion issue\\none of the most controversial scenes was the films ending brians crucifixion many christian protesters said that it was mocking jesus suffering by turning it into a jolly boys outing such as when mr cheeky turns to brian and says see not so bad once youre up capped by brians fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song this is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems for example when brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him he replies oh youll probably get away with crucifixion in another example matthias an old man who works with the peoples front of judea dismisses crucifixion as a doddle and says being stabbed would be worse\\nthe director terry jones issued the following riposte to this criticism any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly the pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for jesus\\nresponses from the cast\\nshortly after the film was released cleese and palin engaged in a debate on the bbc2 discussion programme friday night saturday morning with malcolm muggeridge and mervyn stockwood the bishop of southwark who put forward arguments against the film muggeridge and stockwood it was later claimed had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that brian and jesus were two different characters and hence contended that it was a sendup of christ himself both pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious wellresearched points while the establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring they also expressed disappointment in muggeridge whom all in python had previously respected as a satirist he had recently converted to christianity after meeting mother teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle cleese stated that his reputation had plummeted in his eyes while palin commented he was just being muggeridge preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all muggeridges verdict on the film was that it was such a tenthrate film that it couldnt possibly destroy anyones genuine faith in a 2013 interview on bbc radio 4 cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he was astonished first of all at how stupid the two members of the church were and how boring the debate became he added i think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion  no attempt to find any common ground\\nthe pythons unanimously deny that they were ever out to destroy peoples faith on the dvd audio commentary they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion but that it does not blasphemously lampoon the god that christians and jews worship when jesus does appear in the film on the mount speaking the beatitudes he is played straight by actor kenneth colley and portrayed with respect the music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him the comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace love and tolerance i think he said blessed are the cheese makers importantly he is distinct from the character of brian which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful exleper pesters brian for money while moaning that since jesus cured him he has lost his source of income in the begging trade referring to jesus as a bloody dogooder\\njames crossley however has argued that the film makes the distinction between jesus and the character of brian to make a contrast between the traditional christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to jesus by his followers crossley points out that the film uses the character of brian to address a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about jesus such as the messianic secret the jewishness of jesus jesus the revolutionary and having a single mother\\nnot all the pythons agree on the definition of the movies tone there was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in aspen colorado in 1998 in the section where life of brian is discussed terry jones says i think the film is heretical but its not blasphemous eric idle can be heard to concur adding its a heresy however john cleese disagreeing counters i dont think its a heresy its making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching jones responds of course its a heresy john its attacking the church and that has to be heretical cleese replies no its not attacking the church necessarily its about people who cannot agree with each other\\nin a later interview jones said the film isnt blasphemous because it doesnt touch on belief at all it is heretical because it touches on dogma and the interpretation of belief rather than belief itself\\n21st century\\nthe film continues to cause controversy in february 2007 the church of st thomas the martyr in newcastle upon tyne held a public screening in the church itself with songsheets organ accompaniment stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning although the screening was a sellout some christian groups notably the conservative christian voice were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead stephen green the head of christian voice insisted that you dont promote christ to the community by taking the mick out of him the reverend jonathan adams one of the churchs clergy defended his taste in comedy saying that it did not mock jesus and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion again on the films dvd commentary cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the films highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith\\nsome bans continued into the 21st century in 2008 torbay council finally permitted the film to be shown after it won an online vote for the english riviera international comedy film festival in 2009 it was announced that a thirtyyearold ban of the film in the welsh town of aberystwyth had finally been lifted and the subsequent showing was attended by terry jones and michael palin alongside mayor sue jonesdavies who portrayed judith iscariot in the film however before the showing an aberystwyth university student discovered that a ban had only been discussed by the council and in fact that it had been shown or scheduled to be shown at a cinema in the town in 1981 in 2013 a german official in the state of north rhinewestphalia considered the film to be possibly offensive to christians and hence subject to a local regulation prohibiting its public screening on good friday despite protests by local atheists\\npolitical satire\\nthe film pokes fun at revolutionary groups and 1970s british leftwing politics according to roger wilmut what the film does do is place modern stereotypes in a historical setting which enables it to indulge in a number of sharp digs particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations the groups in the film all oppose the roman occupation of judea but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears to an outsider to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences such disunity indeed fatally beleaguered reallife judean resistance against roman rule michael palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on modern resistance groups all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas\\nthe peoples front of judea composed of the pythons characters harangue their rivals with cries of splitters and stand vehemently opposed to the judean peoples front the campaign for a free galilee and the judean popular front the last composed of a single old man mocking the size of real revolutionary trotskyist factions the infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the pfj attempts to kidnap pontius pilates wife but encounters agents of the campaign for a free galilee and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first when brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle against the common enemy the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison the judean peoples front however they soon resume their fighting and with two roman legionaries watching bemusedly continue until brian is left the only survivor at which point he is captured\\nother scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much there is also a famous scene in which reg gives a revolutionary speech asking what have the romans ever done for us at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the roman occupation such as sanitation medicine education wine public order irrigation roads a fresh water system public health and peace followed by what have the romans ever done for us except sanitation medicine education python biographer george perry notes the peoples liberation front of judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards this joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the babylonian talmud some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the talmudic text\\nfilm analysis\\nthemes and motifs\\nbible\\nthe depictions of jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on christian iconography the resistance fighters leave the sermon on the mount which was a literal recital angry because jesus was too pacifistic for them well blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo in addition to the respectful depiction of jesus the film does not state that there is no god or that jesus is not the son of god the appearance of a leper who says he was healed by jesus is in line with the gospels and their reports about jesus performing miracles\\nany direct reference to jesus disappears after the introductory scenes yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of brian brian being a bastard of a roman centurion could refer to the polemic legend that jesus was the son of the roman soldier panthera disguised as a prophet brian talks about the lilies on the field and states more clearly dont pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from jesus\\nanother significant figure in the film who is named in the gospels is pontius pilate who is humorously given rhotacism although there is a hint to barabbas prior to the crucifixion no character in life of brian bears any resemblances to judas or caiaphas an antisemitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded according to scholars the crucifixion scene a central part of christian iconography is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film it depicts historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion\\nbelief and dogmatism\\nthe intended subject of the satire was not jesus and his teachings but religious dogmatism according to film theorists and statements from monty python this is made clear in the beginning of the film during the sermon on the mount not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what jesus says but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly when jesus said blessed are the peacemakers the audience understands the phonetically similar word cheesemakers and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and beatification of those who produce dairy products\\nlife of brian satirises in the words of david hume the strong propensity of mankind to believe in the extraordinary and the marvellous when brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere in their need to submit to an authority the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah the faithful gather beneath brians window en masse to receive gods blessing this is when brian utters the main message of the film you dont need to follow anybody youve got to think for yourselves monty python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising christians after the film was released\\naccording to terry jones life of brian is not blasphemy but heresy because brian contested the authority of the church whereas the belief in god remained untouched he goes on to mention that christ is saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in his name because they cant agree on how he said it or in what order he said it the dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal which brian lost is in the words of terry jones the history of the church in three minutes kevin shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious\\nfor the most part lost in the religious controversy was the films mockery of factional dogmatism among leftwing parties according to john cleese an almost unmanageable number of leftwing organisations and parties was formed back then in the united kingdom he said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent in the film rather than presenting a common front as their organisational names should imply the leader of the peoples front of judea makes it clear that their hate for the judean peopless front is greater than their hate for the romans they are so caught up in constant debates that the rather looney bunch of revolutionaries indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure so in the end even though they have ample opportunity to rescue brian they instead leave brian on the cross thanking him for his sacrifice\\nhardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the womens movement which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s in accordance with the language of political activists resistance fighter stan wants to exercise his right as a man to be a woman the group accepts him from that moment on as loretta because the right to give birth was not theirs to take also as a result from that the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister\\nindividuality and meaninglessness\\none of the most commentedupon scenes in the film is when brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and dont need to follow anybody according to edward slowik this is a rare moment in which monty python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly life of brian accurately depicts the existentialist view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life\\nbrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of friedrich nietzsche and jeanpaul sartre he is honest to himself and others and lives an authentic life as best as he can however brian is too nave to be called a hero based on the ideas of albert camus for camus the search for the meaning of ones own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world the absurd hero rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run contrary to that brian isnt able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore cant triumph over it\\nin monty python and philosophy kevin shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning he points out that the secondlast verse of the song the film finishes on always look on the bright side of life expresses this message clearly\\nshilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them on this note some people would claim that the film presents a nihilistic world view which contradicts any basis of religion however life of brian offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism shilbrack states in his text he comments that religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you cant fight it\\nlegacy\\nliterature\\nspinoffs include a scriptbook the life of brian of nazareth which was printed backtoback with montypythonscrapbook as a single book the printing of this book also caused problems due to rarely used laws in the united kingdom against blasphemy dictating what can and cannot be written about religion the publisher refused to print both halves of the book and original prints were by two companies\\njulian doyle the films

behindthescenes filming and makeup\\nmusic\\nwith the success of eric idles musical retelling of monty python and the holy grail called spamalot idle announced that he would be giving life of brian a similar treatment the oratorio called not the messiah hes a very naughty boy was commissioned to be part of the festival called luminato in toronto in june 2007 and was writtenscored by idle and john du prez who also worked with idle on spamalot not the messiah is a spoof of handels messiah it runs approximately 50 minutes and was conducted at its world premiere by toronto symphony orchestra music

the church of python claiming that the film is an attack on our lord john cleese and on the members of python who in the sketch are the objects of britains true religious faith this was a parody of the infamous friday night saturday morning programme broadcast a week previously the bishop played by rowan atkinson claims that the reaction to the film has surprised him as he didnt expect the

film rights were purchased by ilya his father alexander salkind and their partner pierre spengler dc wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for superman and approved the producers choices of muhammad ali al pacino james caan steve mcqueen clint eastwood and dustin hoffman the filmmakers felt it was best to film superman and superman ii backtoback and to make a negative pickup deal with warner bros william goldman was approached to write the screenplay while leigh brackett was considered ilya hired alfred bester who began writing a film treatment alexander felt however that bester was not famous enough so he hired mario puzo to write the screenplay at a 600000 salary francis ford coppola william friedkin richard lester who later directed superman ii and iii peter yates john guillermin ronald neame and sam peckinpah were in negotiations to direct peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with ilya george lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to star wars\\nilya wanted to hire steven spielberg to direct but alexander was skeptical feeling it was best to wait until spielbergs big fish opens jaws was very successful prompting the producers to offer spielberg the position but by then spielberg had already committed to close encounters of the third kind guy hamilton was hired as director while puzo delivered his 500page script for superman and superman ii in july 1975 jaxur appeared as one of general zods henchmen with clark kent written as a television reporter dustin hoffman who was previously considered for superman turned down lex luthor\\nin early 1975 brando signed on as jorel with a salary of 37\\xa0million and 1175 of the box office gross profits totaling 19\\xa0million he horrified salkind by proposing in their first meeting that jorel appear as a green suitcase or a bagel with brandos voice but donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray jorel himself brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13part rootsstyle miniseries on native americans in the united states brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in twelve days he also refused to memorize his dialogue so cue cards were compiled across the set fellow oscar winner hackman was cast as lex luthor days later the filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of brandos and hackmans footage because they would be committed to other films immediately though the salkinds felt that puzo had written a solid story for the twopart film they deemed his scripts too long and so hired robert benton and david newman for rewrite work benton became too busy directing the late show so davids wife leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties george macdonald fraser was later hired to do some work on the script but he says he did little\\ntheir script was submitted in july 1976 and had a camp tone including a cameo appearance by telly savalas as his kojak character the scripts for superman and superman ii were now at over 400 pages combined preproduction started at cinecitt studios in rome with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented in italy producer ilya salkind remembered we lost about 2\\xa0million on flying tests marlon brando found out he could not film in italy because of a warrant out for his arrest a sexualobscenity charge from last tango in paris production moved to england in late 1976 but hamilton could not join because he was a tax exile\\nmark robson was strongly considered and was in talks to direct but after seeing the omen the producers hired richard donner donner had previously been planning  when he was hired in january 1977 for 1\\xa0million to direct superman and superman ii donner felt it was best to start from scratch they had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in tom mankiewicz to perform a rewrite according to mankiewicz not a word from the puzo script was used it was a wellwritten but still a ridiculous script it was 550 pages i said you cant shoot this screenplay because youll be shooting for five years donner continued that was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages you know 110 pages is plenty for a script so even for two features that was way too much mankiewicz conceived having each kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter justifying the s on supermans costume the writers guild of america refused to credit mankiewicz for his rewrites so donner gave him a creative consultant credit much to the annoyance of the guild\\ncasting of superman\\nit was initially decided to first sign an alist actor for superman before richard donner was hired as director robert redford was offered a large sum but felt he was too famous burt reynolds also turned down the role while sylvester stallone was interested but nothing ever came of it paul newman was offered his choice of roles as superman lex luthor or jorel for 4\\xa0million turning down all three roles\\nwhen it was next decided to cast an unknown actor casting director lynn stalmaster first suggested christopher reeve but donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny over 200 unknown actors auditioned for superman\\nolympic champion bruce jenner auditioned for the title role patrick wayne was cast but dropped out when his father john wayne was diagnosed with stomach cancer\\nboth neil diamond and arnold schwarzenegger lobbied hard for the role but were ignored james caan james brolin lyle waggoner christopher walken nick nolte jon voight and perry king were approached kris kristofferson and charles bronson were also considered for the title role warren beatty was offered the role but turned it down\\njames caan said he was offered the part but turned it down i just couldnt wear that suit\\nwe found guys with fabulous physique who couldnt act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like superman creative consultant tom mankiewicz remembered the search became so desperate that producer ilya salkinds wifes dentist was screen tested\\nstalmaster convinced donner and ilya to have reeve screen test in february 1977 reeve stunned the director and producers but he was told to wear a muscle suit to produce the desired muscular physique reeve refused undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by david prowse prowse had wanted to portray superman but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not american prowse also auditioned for non reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during preproduction and filming reeve was paid a mere 250000 for both superman and superman ii while his veteran costars received huge sums of money 37\\xa0million for brando and 2\\xa0million for hackman for superman i however reeve felt superman brought me many opportunities rather than closing a door in my face jeff east portrays teenage clark kent easts lines were overdubbed by reeve during postproduction i was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind east commented it was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay chris did a good job but it caused tension between us we resolved our issues with each other years later east also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train he applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble reeve\\nfilming\\nprincipal photography began on march 28 1977 at pinewood studios for krypton scenes budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point since superman was being shot simultaneously with superman ii filming lasted nineteen months until october 1978 filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months but problems arose during production john barry served as production designer while stuart craig and norman reynolds worked as art directors derek meddings and les bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors stuart freeborn was the makeup artist while barry david tomblin john glen david lane robert lynn and an uncredited peter duffell and andr de toth directed second unit scenes vic armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and reeves stunt double his wife wendy leech was kidders double superman was also the final complete film by cinematographer geoffrey unsworth who died during postproduction while working on tess for director roman polanski the fortress of solitude was constructed at shepperton studios and at pinewoods 007 stage upon viewing the footage of krypton warner bros decided to distribute in not only north america but also in foreign countries due to complications and problems during filming warner bros also supplied 20\\xa0million and acquired television rights\\nnew york city doubled for metropolis while the new york daily news building served as the location for the offices of the daily planet brooklyn heights was also used filming in new york lasted five weeks during the time of the new york city blackout of 1977 production moved to alberta for scenes set in smallville with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of beynon alberta the high school football scenes at barons alberta and the kent farm constructed at blackie alberta brief filming also took place in gallup new mexico lake mead and grand central terminal director donner had tensions with the salkinds and spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule creative consultant tom mankiewicz reflected donner never got a budget or a schedule he was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget at one point he said why dont you just schedule the film for the next two days and then ill be nine months over richard lester who worked with the salkinds on the three musketeers and the four musketeers was then brought in as a temporary coproducer to mediate the relationship between donner and the salkinds who by now were refusing to talk to each other with his relationship with spengler donner remarked at one time if id seen him i would have killed him\\nlester was offered producing credit but refused going uncredited for his work salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that donner could not fulfill his directing duties being there all the time meant he lester could take over salkind admitted donner couldnt make up his mind on stuff on lester donner reflected hed been suing the salkinds for his money on three and four musketeers which hed never gotten he won a lot of his lawsuits but each time he sued the salkinds in one country theyd move to another from costa rica to panama to switzerland when i was hired lester told me dont do it dont work for them i was told not to but i did it now im telling you not to but youll probably do it and end up telling the next guy lester came in as a gobetween i didnt trust lester and i told him he said believe me im only doing it because theyre paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit ill never come onto your set unless you ask me ill never go to your dailies if i can help you in any way call me\\nit was decided to stop shooting superman ii and focus on finishing superman donner had already completed 75 of the sequel the filmmakers took a risk if superman was a box office bomb they would not finish superman ii the original climax for superman ii had general zod ursa and non destroying the planet with superman time traveling to fix the damage\\ndonner commented i decided if superman is a success theyre going to do a sequel if it aint a success a cliffhanger aint gonna bring them to see superman ii\\neffects\\nsuperman contains largescale visual effects sequences the golden gate bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide other miniatures included the krypton council dome and the hoover dam slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the hoover dam destruction the fortress of solitude was a combination of a fullscale set and matte paintings the car crashes on the golden gate bridge were a mixture of models and stunt drivers on a disused runway young clark kents longdistance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground the superman costume was to be a much darker blue but the use of blue screen made it transparent\\nas detailed in the superman the movie dvd special effects documentary the magic behind the cape presented by optical effects supervisor roy field in the end three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects\\nfor landings and takeoffs wire flying riggings were devised and used on location these were suspended from tower cranes whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings some of the wireflying work was quite audaciousthe penultimate shot where superman flies out of the prison yard for example although stuntmen were used reeve did much of the work himself and was suspended as high as 50\\xa0feet in the air counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement rather than electronic or motorized devices the thin wires used to suspend reeve were typically removed from the film in postproduction using rotoscope techniques although this wasnt necessary in all shots in certain lighting conditions or when superman is very distant in the frame the wires were more or less imperceptible\\nfor stationary shots where superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera blue screen matte techniques were used reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen while a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement the actor himself would remain stationary save for banking his body instead the camera would use a mixture of long zoomins and zoomouts and dolly indolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame the blue background would then be photochemically removed and reeves isolated image would be inserted into a matted area of a background plate shot the zoomins or zoomouts would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate the disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate the occasional presence of black matte lines where the matte area and the matted imagein this case supermando not exactly match up and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots\\nwhere the shot is tracking with superman as he flies such as in the superman and lois metropolis flying sequence front projection was used this involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3m that would reflect light back directly into a combined cameraprojector the result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection\\na technique was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses the illusion of movement was created by zooming in on reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede for scenes where superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography this also led to the creation of the zoptic system\\nthe highly reflective costumes worn by the kryptonians are made of the same 3m material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during superman flying tests we noticed the material lit up on its own donner explained we tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes designing a front projection effect for each camera there was a little light on each camera and it would project into a mirror bounce out in front of the lens hit the costume and millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera\\nmusic\\njerry goldsmith who scored donners the omen was originally set to compose superman portions of jerry goldsmiths work from planet of the apes were used in supermans teaser trailer he dropped out over scheduling conflicts and john williams was hired williams conducted the london symphony orchestra to record the soundtrack the music was one of the last pieces to come into place williams theme from superman main title was released as a single reaching 81 on the us billboard hot 100 and 69 cash box williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it\\nkidder was supposed to sing can you read my mind the lyrics to which were written by leslie bricusse but donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover maureen mcgovern eventually recorded the single can you read my mind in 1979 although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack it became a midchart hit on the billboard hot 100 that year 52 spending three weeks at number five on the us adult contemporary chart as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding canadian charts it was also a very minor hit on the us country chart reaching 93 both williams and mcgoverns singles contained theme music from the score the score earned john williams an academy award nomination but he lost to giorgio moroders score for midnight express\\nlala land records released the fully expanded restoration of williams score as part of the films 40th anniversary in february 2019\\n  previously unreleased selection\\n  contains previously unreleased material\\nthemes\\nsuperman is divided into three basic sections each having a distinct theme and visual style the first segment set on krypton is meant to be typical of science fiction films but also lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between jorel and kalel the second segment set in smallville is reminiscent of 1950s films and its smalltown atmosphere is meant to evoke a norman rockwell painting the third and largest segment set mostly in metropolis was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible what donner called verisimilitude relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach\\nin each of the three acts the mythic status of superman is enhanced by events that recall the heros journey or monomyth as described by joseph campbell each act has a discernible cycle of call and journey the journey is from krypton to earth in the first act from smallville to the fortress of solitude in the second act and then from metropolis to the whole world in the third act\\nmany have noted the examples of apparent christian symbolism donner tom mankiewicz and ilya salkind have commented on the use of christian references to discuss the themes of superman mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with jorel god and kalel jesus donner is somewhat skeptical of mankiewicz actions joking i got enough death threats because of that\\nseveral concepts and items of imagery have been used in biblical comparisons jorel casts out general zod from krypton a parallel to the casting out of satan from heaven the spacecraft that brings kalel to earth is in the form of a star star of bethlehem kalel comes to jonathan and martha kent who are unable to have children martha kent states all these years how weve prayed and prayed that the good lord would see fit to give us a child which was compared to the virgin mary\\njust as little is known about jesus during his middle years clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do jorel says live as one of them kalel to discover where your strength and power are needed but always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage they can be a great people kalel and they wish to be they only lack the light to show the way for this reason above all their capacity for good i have sent them you my only son the theme resembles the biblical account of god sending his only son jesus to earth in hope for the good of mankind more were seen when donner was able to complete  featuring the fall resurrection and his battle with evil another vision was that of the creation of adam\\nthe christian imagery in the reeve films has provoked comment on the jewish origins of superman rabbi simcha weinsteins book up up and oy vey how jewish history culture and values shaped the comic book superhero says that superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a nebbish saying hes a bumbling nebbish jewish stereotype hes woody allen ironically it is also in the reeve films that clark kents persona has the greatest resemblance to woody allen though his conscious model was cary grants character in bringing up baby this same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in disguised as clark kent jews comics and the creation of the superhero by danny fingeroth\\nin the scene where lois lane interviews superman on the balcony superman replies i never lie salkind felt this was an important point in the film since superman living under his secret identity as clark kent is telling the biggest lie of all time his romance with lois also leads him to contradict jorels orders to avoid altering human history time traveling to save her from dying superman instead takes the advice of jonathan kent his father on earth\\nrelease\\nsuperman was originally scheduled to be released in june 1978 the 40th anniversary of action comics 1 which first introduced superman but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months editor stuart baird reflected filming was finished in october 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later bigbudgeted films today tend to take six to eight months donner for his part wished that he had had another six months i would have perfected a lot of things but at some point youve gotta turn the picture over\\nwarner bros pictures spent 67\\xa0million on marketing the film superman premiered at the uptown theater in washington dc on december 10 1978 with director richard donner and several cast members in attendance three days later on december 13 it had a european

response\\naccording to rotten tomatoes 94 of 69 critics gave superman a positive review with an average rating of 8110 the websites critical consensus reads superman deftly blends humor and gravitas taking advantage of the perfectly cast reeve to craft a loving nostalgic tribute to an american pop culture icon metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 19 critics indicating universal acclaim the film was widely regarded as one of top 10 films of 1978 superman creators jerry siegel and joe shuster gave a positive reaction shuster was delighted to see superman on the screen i got chills chris reeve has just the right touch of humor he really is superman\\nroger ebert gave the film four out of four stars although describing the krypton scenes as ponderous brando was allegedly paid 3 million for his role or judging by his dialogue 500000 a clich ebert wrote that superman is a pure delight a wondrous combination of all the oldfashioned things we never really get tired of adventure and romance heroes and villains earthshaking special effects and  you know what else wit he praised reeve stating that he sells the role wrong casting here would have sunk everything and concluded that the film works so well because of its wit and its special effects ebert placed the film on his ten best list of 1978 he would later go on to place it on his great movies list gene siskel gave the film three stars out of four calling it a delightful mess good performances sloppy editing cheap nonflying special effects funny dialog in sum superman is the kind of picture critics tear apart but still say you ought to see it\\njames harwood of variety called the film a wonderful chuckling preposterously exciting fantasy and further added as both the wholesome man of steel and his bumbling secret identity clark kent reeve is excellent vincent canby of the new york times wrote in a mixed review the superman comic strip has been carefully elaborately sometimes wittily blown up for the bigtheater screen which though busy often seems sort of empty charles champlin of the los angeles times called the film a big letdown praising reeve as the salvaging strength of the film but referring to the matter of the villain as an essential problem finding that even in a succession of wigs gene hackman is not preposterous funny or dementedly menacing and what hes doing here is not evident gary arnold of the washington post wrote in a positive review despite a lull here and a lapse there this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameraschristopher reeve a young actor at once handsome and astute enough to rationalize the preposterous fancy of a comicbook superhero in the flesh dave kehr of chicago reader felt the tone style and point of view change almost from shot to shot this is the definitive corporate film it is best when it takes itself seriously worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp when lex luthor enters the action hackman plays the archvillain like a hairdresser left over from a tv skit\\nwriting in a retrospective review james berardinelli believed theres no doubt that its a flawed movie but its one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s its exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be perhaps most heartening of all however is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of superman ii harry knowles is a longtime fan of the film but was critical of elements that did not represent the superman stories as seen in the comics neal gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy he also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of mario puzos original script and referred to the first three superman films collectively as simply puffedup tv episodes\\naccolades\\nsuperman was nominated for three academy awards best film editing stuart baird best original score john williams and best sound gordon k mccallum graham v hartstone nicolas le messurier and roy charman and received a special achievement academy award for its visual effects donner publicly expressed disgust that production designer john barry and cinematographer

awards and won the grammy award for best score soundtrack for visual media\\ntelevision and home media\\nthe extended tv version\\nwhile by contract richard donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released the salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters this was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the abc television network prior to the films release financially the more footage that was restored for television the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in during production of the film alexander and ilya salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to warner bros in exchange for financial help which is why warner bros would have theatrical and home video distribution rights so by 1981 when the television rights reverted to the salkinds the producers had already prepared a 3hourand8minute version that actually had been the first version of the film visually locked down prior to being reedited for theatrical release this extended cut which would be utilized for worldwide television distribution reincorporated some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut networks and stations could then reedit their own version at their discretion this edit is commonly known as the salkind international television cut\\nabc aired the broadcast television debut of superman over two nights in february 1982 with a majority of the unused footage the 182minute network cut which was slightly cut down for content was repeated in november of that same year this time in its entirety in one evening the remaining two abc broadcasts were presented in its original theatrical version\\nwhen the tv rights reverted to warner bros in 1985 cbs aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version when the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 following a playout run on pay cable tv stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut the stations that showed the extended cut edited the second half to add more advertising time and previously on cutback scenes just as abc had done in 1982\\nin 1994 following a paycable reissue and its obligatory run on usa network warner bros television syndicated the full 188minute international television version most famously on los angeles station kcop the most notable additions unseen on us television were two additional scenes never seen before in addition to what had been previously reinstated this version also surfaced outside of los angeles for example wjla channel 7 an abc affiliate in washington dc aired the extended cut in july 1994 because its first known airing was on the aforementioned kcop it is also known in fan circles as the kcop version\\nthere were various extended tv versions each broadcast in various countries most of these are in pan and scan as they were made in the 1980s when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old tvs\\nuntil 2017 it was thought the quality of the extended network tv version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in 16mm using the film chain system and a mono sound mix done as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981 stereo was not available in television broadcasts 16mm television prints were in fact made and mastered on ntsc standard definition video for the initial abc network broadcasts however during an inventory of the warner bros library an ip master of the full 188minute television version was discovered this eighteenreel master was not marked with an aspect ratio but the print was inspected and as it turned out was in the proper 2351 panavision ratio this was the source of the warner archive collection bluray release of what would officially be called the superman the movie extended cut issued on october 3 2017 the video release was visually restored by wbs imaging department and other than the opening and end credits which are in true stereo the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono tv sound mix this particular release also includes another version discussed below\\nrichard donner was critical of this extended cut of the film he called this version of the film terrible saying it was nothing more than an assembly he said he cut the bad material out of the movie and that the producers and warner bros added it back in just to make a buck\\nother editions\\nwhen michael thau and warner home video started working on a film restoration in 2000 only eight minutes of the added footage that had been used in the tv cut could be considered restored into a version that director richard donner called his preferred version of the film thau determined that some of the extra footage could not be added because of poor visual effects thau felt the pace of the films storyline would be adversely affected and there were timing problems matching footage with john williams musical score etc the cut of the movie shown on kcop was put together to make the movie longer when shown on tv as the television station paid per minute to air the movie the special edition cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making there was a special test screening of the special edition in 2001 in austin texas on march 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year which did not occur in may 2001 warner home video released the special edition on dvd director donner also assisted working slightly over a year on the project the release included makingof documentaries directed by thau and eight minutes of restored footage\\nthau explained i worked on ladyhawke and thats how i really met dick donner and tom mankiewicz i used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that tom and dick and stuart would tell about superman and thats how i kind of got the ideas for the plots of taking flight and making superman donner commented there are a few shots where chris reeves costume looked green we went in and cleaned that up bringing the color back to where it should be thau wanted to make the film shorter i wanted to take out the damn poem where lois is reciting a poem can you read my mind when theyre flying around i also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action it was like a twominute car chase but dick didnt want to take that out or the poem it was followed by a box set release in the same month containing bare bones editions of superman ii superman iii and superman iv the quest for peace in november 2006 a fourdisc special edition was released followed by an hd dvd release and bluray also available with other films is the ninedisc christopher reeve superman collection and the 14disc superman ultimate collectors edition\\non november 6 2018 following yearlong worldwide revival theatrical screenings to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the films original release warner bros home entertainment released an ultra hd bluray of superman presented in a new dolby vision transfer of the original theatrical version straight from the original camera negative with its original 70mmsixtrack stereo mix rendered in 51 surround in addition to the 2000 remix in dolby atmos this new release also includes a standard bluray of the theatrical cut plus select bonus features carried over from previous video releases and digital copies of both the theatrical and threehour tv versions\\nlegacy\\nin 2007 the visual effects society listed superman as the 44thmost influential use of visual effects of all time in 2008 empire magazine named it the 174thgreatest film of all time on its list of 500 in 2009 entertainment weekly ranked superman 3rd on their list of the alltime coolest heroes in pop culture\\nwith the films success it was immediately decided to finish superman ii ilya and alexander salkind and pierre spengler did not ask donner to return because donner had criticized them during the films publicity phase donner commented in january 1979 id work with spengler again but only on my terms as long as he has nothing to say as the producer and is just liaison between alexander salkind and his money thats fine if they dont want it on those terms then they need to go out and find another director it sure as shit aint gonna be me kidder who portrayed lois lane was dissatisfied by the producers decision and also criticized the salkinds during publicity kidder said that as a result she was only given a cameo appearance for superman iii and not a main supporting role jack ohalloran who portrayed non stated it was great to work with donner richard lester was as big an asshole as the salkinds two more films superman iii 1983 and  1987 were produced donners vision for superman ii was eventually realized nearly three decades later when he supervised the editing of  which was released in 2006 in the same year donner and writer geoff johns wrote last son a comic book story arc in action comics featuring superman unused footage of marlon brando as jorel discovered during the restoration of superman ii the richard donner cut was used in superman returns 2006\\nbecause superman went into production prior to the releases of star wars may 1977 and close encounters of the third kind november 1977 some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films\\nin the 1980s this is certainly the view of superman producer ilya salkind and some who have interviewed him as well as of film production assistant brad lohan other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the lucas and spielberg productions and see superman as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two ilya salkind denies any connection between supermanwhich began filming in march 1977and the other films stating that i did not know about star wars star wars did not know about superman close encounters did not know about superman it really was completely independentnobody knew anything about anybody superman also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of lowbudget saturday matinee

brandon teena story many actors sought the lead role during a threeyear casting process before swank was cast swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to brandons most of the films characters were based on reallife people others were composites\\nfilming occurred during october and november 1998 in the dallas texas area the producers initially wanted to film in falls city

night which ends with them having sex\\nthe police detain brandon on charges that arose prior to his relocation they place him in the womens section of the falls city prison lana bails brandon out and asks why he was placed in a womens prison brandon attempts to lie to her saying he was born a hermaphrodite and will soon receive genital reconstruction surgery but lana stops him declaring her love for brandon regardless of his gender however while brandon is in prison candace finds a number of documents listing brandons birth name teena brandon and she and her friends react to this news with shock and disgust they enter brandons room search among brandons things and discover some transgender literature that confirms their suspicions tom and john violently confront brandon forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals they try to make lana look but she shields her eyes and turns away after this confrontation tom and john drag brandon into johns car and drive to an isolated location where they brutally beat and gang rape him\\nafterwards they take brandon to toms house though injured brandon escapes through a bathroom window although his assailants threaten brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police lana persuades him to do so however the police chief proves to be less concerned with the crime than with brandons sexual identity crisis\\nlater john and tom get drunk and drive to candaces house lana attempts to stop them but they find brandon who has been hiding in a nearby shed john shoots brandon under the chin killing him instantly while candace is crying out to them to spare her baby tom shoots her in the head as lana fights with them begging them to stop tom stabs brandons lifeless body john and tom flee the scene while a crying

as lana leaves falls city a letter brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover\\nproduction\\nbackground\\nbrandon teena was a trans man who was gang raped and murdered by a group of male acquaintances in december 1993 when he was 21 kimberly peirce at the time a columbia university film student became interested in the case after reading a 1994 village voice article by donna minkowitz peirce became engrossed in brandons life and death she said the minute i read about brandon i fell in love with the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy the fact that he did it with no role models the leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me the sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of brandons life as part of what eventually causes his death she admired brandons audacity ability to solve complicated problems and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality\\npeirce wanted to tell the story from brandons perspective she was familiar with brandons desire to wear mens clothing i started looking at all the other coverage and a great deal of it was sensational people were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people where to me i knew girls who had passed as boys so brandon was not some weird person to me brandon was a very familiar person peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case believing the american public were generally misinformed she said people were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and i think thats really dangerous especially with this culture of violence that we live in peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title take it like a man\\nthe project drew interest from various production companies diane keatons production company blue relief showed interest in the screenplay in the mid1990s initially the film was to be largely based on aphrodite jones 1996 true crime book all she wanted which told the story of brandons final few weeks earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring brandons family background including his sister tammy and mother joann as well as some of teenas exgirlfriends however peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between brandon and his 19yearold girlfriend lana tisdel which peirce termed a great love story in contrast to all she wanted which did not place an emphasis on the relationship\\nto fund the writing and development of the project peirce worked as a paralegal on a midnight shift and as a 35mm film projectionist she also received a grant from the new york foundation for the arts the project attracted the attention of producer christine vachon who had seen a short film peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case ifc films hart sharp entertainment and killer films vachon and eva kolodners production company provided financing for the project ifc contributed roughly 1 million but the films eventual budget remained under 2 million peirce cowrote the screenplay with andy bienen they worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to mythologize brandon the aim was to keep him as human as possible in the editing stage of the script peirce sent the draft to fox searchlight pictures which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving peirce artistic license\\nprior to filming peirce researched the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case she immersed herself in the information available about the murder including trial transcripts she met lana tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at tisdels home tisdel who began dating brandon just two weeks before he was murdered was 19 years old at the time of the murders and lived in falls city with her mother peirce also interviewed tisdels mother and brandons acquaintances however she was unable to interview brandons mother or any of his biological family much factual information including nissen being a convicted arsonist was incorporated into boys dont cry\\ncasting\\nthe filmmakers retained the names of most of the cases reallife protagonists but the names of several supporting characters were altered for example the character of candace was named lisa lambert in real life the casting process for boys dont cry lasted almost four years drew barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film peirce scouted the lgbt community looking mainly for masculine lesbian women for the role of brandon teena peirce said the lgbt community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder highprofile actors avoided peirces auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role\\nat one point the project was nearly abandoned because peirce was not satisfied with most of the people who auditioned in 1996 after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected the relatively unknown actor hilary swank sent a videotape to peirce and was signed on to the project swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition during her audition swank who was 22 lied to peirce about her age swank said that like brandon she was 21 years of age when peirce later confronted her about her lie swank responded but thats what brandon would do swanks anonymity as an actor persuaded peirce to cast her peirce said she did not want a known actor to portray teena in addition peirce felt that swanks audition was the first time i saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines but who was this beautiful androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants who smiled and loved being brandon\\npeirce required that swank make a full transformation into a male immediately after being cast peirce took swank to a hairdresser where her lowerback length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown when she saw her thenhusband chad lowe again he barely recognized her swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man for at least a month including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her trousers as brandon teena had done her masquerade was convincing swanks neighbors believed the young man coming and going from her home was swanks visiting brother she reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume swank earned 75 per day for her work on boys dont cry totaling 3000 her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance\\nfor the role of brandons girlfriend lana tisdel peirce had envisioned a teenage jodie foster the role was also offered to reese witherspoon and sarah polley peirce ultimately decided to cast chlo sevigny based on her performance in the last days of disco 1998 sevigny had auditioned for the role of brandon but peirce decided sevigny would be more suited to playing lana because she could not picture sevigny as a man\\nsevigny dyed her hair red for the role to match lanas strawberry blonde hair peirce later said chlo just surrendered to the part she watched videos of lana she just became her very naturally\\npeter sarsgaard played john lotter lanas former boyfriend who raped and murdered teena sarsgaard was one of the first choices for the role he later said he wanted his character to be likable sympathetic even because he wanted the audience to understand why they would hang out with me if my character wasnt necessarily likable i wanted him to be charismatic enough that you werent going to have a dull time if you were with him in another interview sarsgaard said he felt empowered by playing lotter in an interview with the independent sarsgaard said i felt very sexy weirdly playing john lotter i felt like i was just like the sheriff yknow and that everyone loved me sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about lotter to prepare for the role peirce cast alicia goranson known for playing becky on the sitcom roseanne as candace because of her likeness to lisa lambert like sevigny goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role\\nprincipal photography\\ninitially boys dont cry was scheduled to film for thirty days however principal photography for the film lasted from october 19 to november 24 1998 the small budget dictated some of the filming decisions including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing timing constraints and peirces visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative for example the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person phillip devinea black disabled manwas also killed at the scene at the time he had been dating lana tisdels sister leslie who was omitted from the story boys dont cry was primarily filmed in greenville texas a small town about northeast of dallas most of the incidents in the case took place in falls city nebraska but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in texas\\npeirce initially wanted to shoot in falls city but vachon told her that filming there would not be possible afterwards the film was going to be shot in omaha nebraska but peirce felt that none of the places looked right in addition peirce also scouted filming locations in kansas and florida before deciding on texas one of peirces main goals was for the audience to sympathize with brandon on the films dvd commentary track peirce said the work was informing me about how i wanted to represent it i wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place this character so they could entertain these contradictions in brandons own mind and would not think he was crazy would not think he was lying but would see him as more deeply human\\nsome scenes in boys dont cry required emotional and physical intensity these were allocated extended periods of filming the scene in which brandon at the wishes of his friends bumperskis on the back of a pickup truck was delayed when a police officer just arriving at a shift change required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other the scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background there were some technical complications some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck teenas rape scene was given an extended filming time sexton who portrayed one of the attackers walked away in tears afterward swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to keep a distance from the reality of the actual event when scenes became difficult swank requested the company of her husband on set at times peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours\\ncinematography\\npeirce who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking applied techniques she had learned into the film she described the films mood as artificial night director of photography jim denault showed her the work of photographer jan staller whose longexposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired denault to avoid using moonlight effects for most of the film as a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night john pirozzi who had been experimenting with timelapse photography using a nonmotioncontrolled moving camera was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film\\nthe films visual style depicts the midwestern united states in a withdrawn dark and understated light to give a surreal effect denault shot boys dont cry in flat spherical format on 35mm film using kodak vision film stock the film was shot with a moviecam compact camera fitted with carl zeiss super speed lenses for the scene in which brandon is stripped a handheld camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy\\nthe use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman for this scene peirce used a threeshot method similar to that used in a scene in the wizard of oz 1939 in which dorothy leaves her house and enters oz the scene consists of a threeshot sequence meant to symbolize brandons metaphorical entrance to manhood or brandons social transition from a woman to a man some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination an example is the sequence in which brandon and lana first have sex followed by a shot of her brandon candace and kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop the scene in which john and tom strip brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints even though peirce wanted six cameras to film it the scene took an hour and a half to film in total\\npeirce drew inspiration from the filming style of john cassavetes and the early work of martin scorsese and she incorporated neorealist techniques into the film she was also influenced by a second style of workthe magical films of michael powell and kenji mizoguchi the former style is used when brandon joins the social circle of john tom lana and her mother while the latter is used when brandon and lana begin to depart from that life the film was also influenced by bonnie and clyde 1967 peirce incorporated influences from raging bull 1980 by opening the film with a shot of brandon traveling along a highway as seen from the characters imaginative or dream perspective similar to the beginning of raging bull when a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion peirce cuts to an eerily lit dream landscape the pawnbroker 1964 inspired the cinematography and editing of brandons rape scene particularly in its use of fast cutting\\nmusic\\nbecause the film is set in the rural midwestern united states the boys dont cry soundtrack album features a compilation of country blues and rock music nathan larson and nina persson of the cardigans composed an instrumental version of restless hearts 1988 countrypop song the bluest eyes in texas a variation of which was used as the films love theme and score the song itself is heard during a karaoke scene sung by sevignys character and at the end of the film the title of the film is taken from the song of the same name by british rock band the cure an american cover of the song sung by nathan larson plays in the background in the scene in which lana bails brandon out of jail and during one of their sex scenes however the song is not included on the released soundtrack songs by lynyrd skynyrd tuesdays gone paisley underground band opal shes a diamond and the charlatans codine blues also appear in the film as do cover versions of other songs the soundtrack was released on november 23 1999 by koch records the bluest eyes in texas was played when hilary swank went onstage to receive her academy award for best actress in 2000 the song also plays over the films end credits\\nthemes and analysis\\nboys dont cry has been widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and others roger ebert described the film as a romantic tragedy embedded in a working class american setting calling it romeo and juliet set in a nebraska trailer park philosopher rebecca hanrahan argued that the question of identityparticularly brandonsis alluded to frequently in boys dont cry and that peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the films main question journalist janet maslin said the film is about accepting identity which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity paula nechak called the film a bold cautionary tale she regarded the film as a negative dismal depiction of midwestern america writing that peirces film has captured the mystique and eerie loneliness and isolation of the midwest with its dusty desolation and nowheretogo frustration that propels people to violence and despair\\nchristine vachon the films executive producer said its not just about two stupid thugs who killed somebody its about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they cant stand to have any of their beliefs shattered referring to john and toms views of their lives brandons aspirations and his biological sex along with other turnofthemillennium films such as in the company of men 1997 american beauty 1999 fight club 1999 and american psycho 2000 vincent hausmann said boys dont cry raises the broader widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis jason wood said the film together with patty jenkinss monster 2003 is an exploration of social problems\\nromantic and platonic relationships\\nseveral scholars commented on the relationship between brandon and lana as well as brandons relationship to john and tom carol siegel regarded the film as a thematically rich love story between two illfated lovers similar to romeo and juliet jack halberstam attributed boys dont crys success to its ostensible argument for tolerance of sexual diversity by depicting a relationship between two unlikely people\\nthis tragic aspect of the love story led halberstam to compare brandon and lanas relationship and subsequent drama to classic and modern romances including romeo and juliet often using the term starcrossed lovers in the journal for creativity in mental health jinnelle veronique aguilar discussed brandons ability to create interpersonal relationships in the film she opined that brandon wanted to create close relationships but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with lana although brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with lana he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world he consistently faces a sense of fear related to the powerover dynamics that he and others who are transsexual facebrandon experiences the central relational paradox in which he yearns for connection however due to the real threat he faces he is unable to make that connection\\nmyra hird in the international feminist journal of politics argued that john and brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity and that brandons version is preferred by the films female characters comparing them to arnold schwarzenegger and jimmy stewart respectively throughout the film john offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity  against this hegemonic masculinity brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a bygone era of chivalry furthermore she contended that john was threatened by brandons version of masculinity gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in western society and boys dont cry depicts how intensely threatened john and tom are by brandons superior portrayal of a masculinity schedule john cannot abide brandons desire and clear ability to access male privilege and his reaction is to force brandon to be female through the act of rape\\ncauses of violence against lgbt people\\nother commentators discussed the more complex psychological causes of brandons murder halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder and whether it was due to transphobia or homophobia ultimately in boys dont cry the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage ebert called the film a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame\\nin the same journal julianne pidduck commented on the films rape and murder scenes effectively the viewer is asked to experience the rape from the victims point of view the film invites political emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk especially for female andor queer viewers an allegiance with brandons outsider status aligns the viewer with brandons initial exhilaration at his transgressive success as a boy drawing us through to the films disturbing finale\\nself and transgender identity\\nmany scholars addressed the various performances of gender by the characters in the film moss and lynne zeavin offered a psychoanalytic analysis calling the film a case report that presents brandons transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests and focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her transsexuality  or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria but for what they might reveal about misogyny elaborating on the themes of the film they wrote\\nin her film pierce sic inserts the unconventional problems of transsexuality into a conventional narrative structure throughout the film brandon is presented as a doomed though beguiling and beautiful rascal recognizably located in the lineage of wellknown cinematic badboys like james dean steve mcqueen and paul newman like these predecessors brandons heroic stature derives from her sic unwillingness to compromise her sic identity  pierce sic presents brandons struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade\\nbrenda cooper in critical studies in media communication argued that the film can be read as a liberatory narrative that queers the centers of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity by privileging female masculinity and celebrating its differences from heterosexual norms she argued that the film challenged heteronormativity by criticizing the concept of the american heartland by presenting problems with heterosexual masculinity and its internalised aggression by centering female masculinity and blurring gender boundaries\\nlater on in the same essay she commented that brandon both embodied and rejected traditional masculinity providing a new outlook on what it means to be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film brandons performance of masculinity however can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives when brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that john and tom represent but lana falls for brandon because of his version of masculinity which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it takes to be a man and to please a woman brandons articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity michele aaron in screen claimed that the film was primarily centered on the spectacle of transvestism and that the film as a whole was a tale of passing\\njennifer esposito wrote that we watch onscreen as brandon binds his breasts packs a dildo fixes his hair in a mirror his masculinity is carefully scripted john and tomare never shown preparing for masculinity they are already masculine melissa rigney argued that the film defied traditional portrayals of transgender characters by not confining brandon to certain stereotypes on the surface boys dont cry appears to hold the potential of rendering gender in excess the figure of brandon teena can be read variously as butch male lesbian transgender transsexual and heterosexual  although female masculinity comes to the forefront in this film i argue that the film attempts to subsume the transgressive potential of the gender outlaw within a lesbian framework and narrative one that reduces and ultimately nullifies brandons gender and sexual excess\\nin contrast annabelle wilcox opined that the film primarily reinforced the gender binary by showing that brandons body is branded by such rhetoric and representation and is assumed to be a site of truth that closes the question that being transgender poses for subjectivity gender and sexuality she also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded brandons male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him rachel swan writing for film quarterly wrote that brandons masculinity was often contrasted with lanas femininity as a means of illustrating the two sides of the gender binary in addition she regarded john and toms rape of brandon as an attempt to psychologically castrate him\\nin another piece halberstam compared the media portrayal of brandon to that of billy tipton a jazz musician who no one knew was transgender until the postmortem discovery that he was assigned female at birth she wrote on some level brandons story while cleaving to its own specificity needs to remain an open narrativenot a stable narrative of ftm transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing not a cautionary fable about the violence of rural america nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community like the narrative of billy tipton brandons story permits a dream of transformation christine dando argued that masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces\\nsocial class and race\\nlisa henderson commented on the intersection between social class and gender in the film particularly brandons workingclass status my reading of boys dont cry through the lens of class representation is not born of a univocal search for socalled positive images but i do recoil at what appears to me to be a new instalment in a long history of popular images of workingclass pathology  but that is not the whole story within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening nighttime light characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love acceptance and a better life\\njennifer devere brody commented on the films exclusion of philip devine a disabled africanamerican man who was another victim of the shooting perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision but the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations the erasure of devine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime and the films inability to show devine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime regarding devine halberstam wrote peirce perhaps thought that her film already running close to two hours could not handle another subplot but the story of philip devine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender race sexuality and class that was enacted in the heartland race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white midwestern small towns and by omitting devines story from boys dont cry peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race consigning the memory of devine to oblivion\\nculture of the midwestern united states\\nseveral authors commented on the possible impact that the films setting of falls city nebraska located in the midwestern united states could have had on the films plot maslin called boys dont cry a tale of a trapped small town characters search for life beyond the rural existence and the high price he pays for his view of the american dream regarding the films portrayal of nebraska halberstam wrote the landscape of nebraska then serves as a contested site upon which multiple narratives unfold narratives indeed which refuse to collapse into simply one story some of these narratives are narratives of hate some of desire others tell of ignorance and brutality still others of isolation and fear some allow violence and ignorant prejudices to become the essence of white poor rural identity still others provoke questions about the deployment of whiteness and the regulation of violence\\nchristina dando wrote that the typical portrayal of the midwest as a frontier area did not come through in the film until the setting switched from lincoln to falls city the flat landscape the spacious sky the home evoke two different plains time periods familiar to many americans through historic photographs the early settlement processand 1930s farm security administration photographs it is virtually timeless there is also a sense of both place and placelessness while the landscape is distinctively plains it could be described as nowhere\\nshe went on to argue that the setting is not only conveyed visually but also through the characters homes while there is no trailer park in falls city brandons community there occupies the margin candace and lanas homes appear to be on the outskirts of town or even outside of town there are no complete families only the family that that has been created the men appear to have no homes relationally or physically none are shown to have family speaking about the films cinematography and the relation to its themes\\ndando compared the film to other tragic books and films that have been set on the great plains including my ntonia giants in the earth the grapes of wrath in cold blood and badlands writing that unlike the other works brandon is a character who truly crosses frontiers\\nrelease\\npremiere and commercial

reviewer said the film was a critical knockout\\ncritics often praised the performances by swank and sevigny peter travers said the pair give performances that burn in the memory and the film stage termed swanks performance one of the greatest best actress oscarwinning performances peter stack of the san francisco chronicle lauded the lead acting performances of swank sevigny saarsgard and sexton iii writing it may be the bestacted film of the year online film reviewer james berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four he highlighted the performances of swank and sevigny as the films greatest success and likened the films intensity to that of a train wreck berardinelli wrote that swank gives the performance of her career and that sevignys performance is more conventional than swanks but no less effective she provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film emanuel levy of variety called the acting flawless and concluded that the stunningly accomplished and candid film could be seen as a rebel without a cause for these culturally diverse and complex times with the two misfits enacting a version of the james deannatalie wood romance with utmost conviction searching like their 50s counterparts for love selfworth and a place to call home stephen hunter of the washington post said the performances are of such luminous humanity that they break your heart premiere listed swanks performance as one of the 100 greatest performances of all time owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly called swank a revelation and wrote by the end her brandonteena is beyond male or female its as if we were simply glimpsing the characters soul in all its yearning and conflicted beauty\\nother reviewers were positive towards the way boys dont cry portrayed its subject matter and roger ebert of the chicago suntimes listed boys dont cry as one of the five best films of 1999 saying this could have been a clinical movie of the week but instead its a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame janet maslin of the new york times said the film was stunning and gave it four stars out of four stars maslin said unlike most films about mindnumbing tragedy this one manages to be full of hope kenneth turan of the los angeles times praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters and wrote peirce and bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless hopeless stonedout lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them and that boys dont cry is an exceptionaland exceptionally disturbing film mike clarke of usa today commended peirces depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter writing peirce seems to have researched her subject with gradschoolthesis intensity\\njay carr of the boston globe wrote boys dont cry not only revisits the crime but convinces us were being taken inside it stephanie zacharek of salon gave a positive review singling out the directing and acting she wrote peirce  covers an extraordinary amount of territory not just in terms of dealing with brandons sexualidentity and selffulfillment issues but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him zacharek described swanks performance as a continual revelation and sevignys performance as transformative she said when brandon dies boys dont cry reaches an emotional intensity thats almost operatic the saddest thing though is seeing sevignys lana crumpled over his corpsethe way she plays it you know that when brandon went he took a part of her with him too david edelstein of slate was also very positive towards the film calling it a meditation on the irrelevance of gender he went on to praise swank sevigny and sarsgaard in their roles especially sevigny writing that she keeps the movie tantalizing\\nthe film was not without detractors who focused on the films portrayal of brandon and his actions richard corliss of time magazine was one of the films negative reviewers he wrote the film lets down the material its too cool all attitude no sizzle peter rainer of new york magazine compared the film unfavorably with rebel without a cause 1954 calling it a transgendered  version elaborating that the film could have used a tougher and more exploratory spirit for peirce there was no cruelty no derangement in brandons impostures toward the unsuspecting in 2007 premiere ranked the film on its list of the 25 most dangerous movies\\nthe film was generally wellreceived by the lgbt community boys dont crys release came a year after the murder of a homosexual teenager matthew shepard which occurred october 12 1998 the murder sparked additional public interest in hate crime legislation in america and in brandon teena and increased public interest in boys dont cry cooper wrote that boys dont cry is perhaps the only film addressing the issue of female masculinity by a selfdescribed queer filmmaker to reach mainstream audiences and to receive critical acclaim and prestigious awards however noelle howey writing for mother jones wrote that despite the critical acclaim relatively few critics understood what she perceived as the main point of the filmbrandon being a victim of trans bashing howey said even a cursory glance at reviews of boys dont cry reveals that while most critics admired the film few absorbed its main point that brandon teena was a biological girl who felt innately that she was a man most of the media instead cast teena as a yentl for the new millennium rather than a victim of antitransgender bigotry\\nfactual accuracy\\nthe accuracy of boys dont cry was disputed by reallife people involved in the murder the real lana tisdel declared her dislike for the film she said brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered brandon was transgender she ended the relationship tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film and called the film the second murder of brandon teena before the films theatrical release lana tisdel sued the films producers claiming that the film depicted her as lazy white trash and a skanky snake and that her family and friends had come to see her as a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder tisdel settled her lawsuit against fox searchlight for an undisclosed sum sarah nissen cousin of perpetrator marvin nissen was also critical of the film saying theres none of it thats right it was just weird leslie tisdel lanas sister called the film a lie of a movie\\nlana tisdels potential involvement in the rape and murder of brandon teena was also highlighted various people involved in the case particularly brandons family have alleged that tisdel was somehow involved with the murders or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance perhaps the most notable admission about tisdels motives came from tom nissen who infamously confessed that tisdel was present at the time of the murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where brandon lambert and devine were staying\\nawards and nominations\\nthe film won a variety of awards most of which went to swank for her performance swank won a best actress oscar while sevigny received a nomination in the category of best supporting actress from the hollywood foreign press the film received two golden globe

actress sevigny and best director peirce swank and sevigny won satellite awards for their performances and the film was nominated in two categories best picture drama and best director it was named one of the best films of the year by the national board of review of motion pictures\\nthe family of brandon teena criticized swank for her repeated use of the male gender pronoun he in her oscar acceptance speech teenas mother joann brandon said her childs transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse rather than being an expression of teenas gendered sense of self she said she pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her despite the criticism kevin okeefe writing for out defended swanks acceptance speech he said swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold not only as an actress but as an award winner\\nrating and home media\\nboys dont cry garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene the film was initially assigned an nc17 rating from the motion picture association of america mpaa the content was toned down for the us release where it was rated r peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled this film is not yet rated which discussed the films problems with the mpaa particularly the censoring of the sex scenes the portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the mpaa and had to be trimmed to avoid the nc17 rating both the australian and european version are more explicit particularly the first rape peirce was angry because the mpaa wanted the sex scene between brandon and lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene she also claimed that one objection from the mpaa was that one scene featured an orgasm that was too long and rhetorically asked if anyone had ever been hurt by an orgasm that was too long\\nboys dont cry was first released on home video by fox searchlight pictures in september 2000 apart of a premiere series preceded by a dvd release in april 2000 in the united states and canada the dvds special features included a commentary by kimberly peirce and a behindthescenes featurette

thompson  a firsttime screenwriter  was the credited writer but columbia pictures agreed to distribute the film though initially intending to have another actress portray elinor thompson was persuaded to take the role\\nthompsons screenplay exaggerated the dashwood familys wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences it also altered the traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers elinor and mariannes different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes lee was selected as director both for his work in the 1993 film the wedding banquet and because doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience lee was given a budget of 16 million\\nsense and sensibility was released on 13 december

his face and rides away\\nproduction\\nconception and adaptation\\nin 1989 lindsay doran the new president of production company mirage enterprises was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the jane austen novel sense and sensibility to her colleagues it had been adapted twice most recently in a 1981 television serial doran was a longtime fan of the novel and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry she chose to adapt this particular austen work because there were two female leads doran stated that all of austens books are funny and emotional but sense and sensibility is the best movie story because its full of twists and turns just when you think you know whats going on everything is different its got real suspense but its not a thriller irresistible she also praised the novel for possessing wonderful characters\\xa0 three strong love stories surprising plot twists good jokes relevant themes and a heartstopping ending\\nprior to being hired at mirage the producer had spent years looking for a suitable screenwriter  someone who was equally strong in the areas of satire and romance and could think in austens language almost as naturally as he or she could think in the language of the twentieth century doran read screenplays by english and american writers until she came across a series of comedic skits often in period settings that actress emma thompson had written doran believed the humour and style of writing was exactly what shed been searching for thompson and doran were already working together on mirages 1991 film dead again a week after its completion the producer selected thompson to adapt sense and sensibility although she knew that thompson had never written a screenplay also a fan of austen thompson first suggested they adapt persuasion or emma before agreeing to dorans proposal the actress found that sense and sensibility contained more action than she had remembered and decided it would translate well to drama\\nthompson spent five years writing and revising the screenplay both during and between shooting other films believing the novels language to be far more arcane than in austens later books thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the elegance and wit of the original she observed that in a screenwriting process a first draft often had a lot of good stuff in it but needed to be edited and second drafts would almost certainly be rubbish\\xa0 because you get into a panic thompson credited doran that she could help me nourish me and mentor me through that process\\xa0 i learned about screenwriting at her feet\\nthompsons first draft was more than three hundred handwritten pages which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length she found the romances to be the most difficult to juggle and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented willoughby and edward doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until willoughbys arrival with edward sidelined as backstory thompson and doran quickly realised that if we didnt meet edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people\\xa0 then it wasnt going to work at the same time thompson wished to avoid depicting a couple of women waiting around for men gradually her screenplay focused as much on the dashwood sisters relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests\\nwith the draft screenplay doran pitched the idea to various studios in order to finance the film but found that many were wary of the beginner thompson as the screenwriter she was considered a risk as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script columbia pictures executive amy pascal supported thompsons work and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor\\nas thompson mentioned on the bbc program qi in 2009 at one point in the writing process a computer failure almost lost the entire work in panic thompson called fellow actor and close friend stephen fry the host of qi and a selfprofessed geek after seven hours fry was able to recover the documents from the device while thompson had tea with hugh laurie who was at frys house at the time\\nlees hire\\ntaiwanese director ang lee was hired as a result of his work in the 1993 family comedy film the wedding banquet which he cowrote produced and directed he was not familiar with jane austen doran felt that lees films which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context were a good fit with austens storylines she recalled the idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didnt have english as his first language the producer sent lee a copy of thompsons script to which he replied that he was cautiously interested fifteen directors were interviewed but according to doran lee was one of the few who recognised austens humour he told them he wanted the film to break peoples hearts so badly that theyll still be recovering from it two months later\\nfrom the beginning doran wanted sense and sensibility to appeal to both a core audience of austen aficionados as well as younger viewers attracted to romantic comedy films she felt that lees involvement prevented the film from becoming just some little english movie that appealed only to local audiences instead of to the wider world lee said\\ni thought they were crazy i was brought up in taiwan what do i know about 19thcentury england about halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me in my films ive been trying to mix social satire and family drama i realised that all along i had been trying to do jane austen without knowing it jane austen was my destiny i just had to overcome the cultural barrierbecause thompson and doran had worked on the screenplay for so long lee described himself at the time as a director for hire as he was unsure of his role and position he spent six months in england learning how to make this movie how to do a period film culturally\\xa0 and how to adapt to the major league film industry\\nin january 1995 thompson presented a draft to lee doran coproducer laurie borg and others working on the production and spent the next two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback thompson would continue making revisions throughout production of the film including altering scenes to meet budgetary concerns adding dialogue changes and changing certain aspects to better fit the actors brandons confession scene for instance initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before thompson decided it was emotionally more interesting to let brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult\\ncasting\\nthompson initially hoped that doran would cast sisters natasha and joely richardson as elinor and marianne dashwood lee and columbia wanted thompson herself now a bigdeal movie star after her critically successful role in the 1992 film howards end to play elinor the actress replied that at the age of thirtyfive she was too old for the nineteenyearold character lee suggested elinors age be changed to twentyseven which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand thompson agreed later stating that she was desperate to get into a corset and act it and stop thinking about it as a script\\nthe formal casting process began in february 1995 though some of the actors met with thompson the previous year to help her conceptualise the script lee eventually cast all but one of them hugh grant as edward ferrars robert hardy as sir john middleton harriet walter as fanny ferrars dashwood imelda staunton as charlotte jennings palmer and hugh laurie as mr palmer amanda root had also worked with thompson on the screenplay but had already committed to star in the 1995 film persuasion commenting on the casting of laurie whom she had known for years thompson has said there is no one else on the planet who could capture mr palmers disenchantment and redemption so perfectly and make it funny\\nthompson wrote the part of edward ferrars with grant in mind and he agreed to receive a lower salary in line with the films budget grant called her screenplay genius explaining ive always been a philistine about jane austen herself and i think emmas script is miles better than the book and much more amusing grants casting was criticised by the jane austen society of north america jasna whose representatives said that he was too handsome for the part actress kate winslet initially intended to audition for the role of marianne but lee disliked her work in the 1994 drama film heavenly creatures she auditioned for the lesser part of lucy steele winslet pretended she had heard that the audition was still for marianne and won the part based on a single reading thompson later said that winslet only nineteen years old approached the part energised and open realistic intelligent and tremendous fun the role helped winslet become recognised as a significant actress\\nalso appearing in the film was alan rickman who portrayed colonel brandon thompson was pleased that rickman could express the extraordinary sweetness of his nature as he had played machiavellian types so effectively in other films greg wise was cast as mariannes other romantic interest john willoughby his most noted role thus far twelveyearold emilie franois appearing as margaret dashwood was one of the last people cast in the production she had no professional acting experience thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement  she creates spontaneity in all of us just by being there other cast members included gemma jones as mrs dashwood james fleet as john dashwood elizabeth spriggs as mrs jennings imogen stubbs as lucy steele richard lumsden as robert ferrars tom wilkinson as mr dashwood and lone vidahl as miss grey\\ncostume design\\naccording to austen scholar linda troost the costumes used in sense and sensibility helped emphasise the class and status of the various characters particularly among the dashwoods they were created by jenny beavan and john bright a team of designers best known for merchant ivory films who began working together in 1984 the two attempted to create accurate period dress and featured the fuller classical look and colours of the late 18th century they found inspiration in the works of the english artists thomas rowlandson john hopper and george romney and also reviewed fashion plates stored in the victoria and albert museum the main costumes and hats were manufactured at cosprop a londonbased costumer company\\nto achieve the tightly wound curls fashionably inspired by greek art some of the actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls fanny the snobbiest of the characters possesses the tightest of curls but has less of a greek silhouette a reflection of her wealth and silliness beavan stated that fanny and mrs jennings couldnt quite give up the frills and instead draped themselves in lace fur feathers jewellery and rich fabrics conversely sensible elinor opts for simpler accessories such as a long gold chain and a straw hat fannys shallow personality is also reflected in flashy colourful dresses while edwards buttonedup appearance represents his repressed personality with little visible skin each of the 100 extras used in the london ballroom scene depicting soldiers and lawyers to fops and dowagers don visually distinct costumes\\nfor brandons costumes beavan and bright consulted with thompson and lee and decided to have him project an image of experienced and dependable masculinity brandon is first seen in black but later he wears sporting gear in the form of corduroy jackets and shirtsleeves his rescue of marianne has him transforming into the romantic byronic hero sporting an unbuttoned shirt and loose cravat in conjunction with his tragic backstory brandons flattering costumes help his appeal to the audience beavan and brights work on the film earned them a nomination for best costume design at the 68th academy awards\\nfilming\\nthe film was budgeted at 16 million the largest ang lee had yet received as well as the largest awarded to an austen film that decade in the wake of the success of columbias 1994 film little women the american studio authorised lees relatively high budget out of an expectation that it would be another crossover hit and appeal to multiple audiences thus yielding high box office returns nevertheless doran considered it a low budget film and many of the ideas thompson and lee came up with  such as an early dramatic scene depicting mr dashwoods bloody fall from a horse  were deemed unfilmable from a cost perspective\\naccording to thompson lee arrived on set with the whole movie in his head rather than focus on period details he wanted the film to concentrate on telling a good story he showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels including barry lyndon and the age of innocence which he believed to be great movies everybody worships the art work but its not what we want to do lee criticised the latter film for lacking energy in contrast to the passionate tale of sense and sensibility\\nthe cast and crew experienced slight culture shock with lee on a number of occasions he expected the assistant directors to be the tough ones and keep production on schedule while they expected the same of him this led to a slower schedule in the early stages of production additionally according to thompson the director became deeply hurt and confused when she and grant made suggestions for certain scenes which was something that was not done in his native country lee thought his authority was being undermined and lost sleep though this was gradually resolved as he became used to their methods the cast grew to trust his instincts so completely making fewer and fewer suggestions coproducer james schamus stated that lee also adapted by becoming more verbal and willing to express his opinion\\nlee became known for his frightening tendency not to mince words he often had the cast do numerous takes for a scene to get the perfect shot and was not afraid to call something boring if he disliked it thompson later recalled that lee would always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing such as asking her not to look so old she also commented however that he doesnt indulge us but is always kind when we fail due to thompsons extensive acting experience lee encouraged her to practice tai chi to help her relax and make her do things simpler other actors soon joined them in meditating  according to doran it was pretty interesting there were all these pillows on the floor and these palelooking actors were saying what have we got ourselves into lee was more focused on body language than any director ive ever seen or heard of he suggested winslet read books of poetry and report back to him to best understand her character he also had thompson and winslet live together to develop their characters sisterly bond many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding sidesaddle\\nlee found that in contrast to chinese cinema he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a very stagy very english tradition instead of just being observed like a human being and getting sympathy they feel they have to do things they have to carry the movie grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an overthetop performance lee later recalled that the actor is a show stealer you cant stop that i let him do i have to say less star stuff the hugh grant thing\\xa0 and not let the movie serve him which is probably what hes used to now for the scene in which elinor learns edward is unmarried thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her fathers death grant was unaware that thompson would cry through most of his speech and the actress attempted to reassure him theres no other way and i promise you itll work and it will be funny as well as being touching and he said oh all right and he was very good about it lee had one demand for the scene that thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera\\nlocations\\nproduction of sense and sensibility was scheduled for fiftyeight days though this was eventually extended to sixtyfive filming commenced in midapril 1995 at a number of locations in devon beginning with saltram house standing in for norland park where winslet and jones shot the first scene of the production when their characters read about barton cottage as saltram was a national trust property schamus had to sign a contract before production began and staff with the organisation remained on set to carefully monitor the filming production later returned to shoot several more scenes finishing there on 29 april the second location of filming flete house stood in for part of mrs jennings london estate where edward first sees elinor with lucy representing barton cottage was a flete estate stone cottage called efford house in holbeton which thompson called one of the most beautiful spots weve ever seen\\nearly may saw production at the exquisite st marys church in berry pomeroy for the final wedding scene from the tenth to the twelfth of may mariannes first rescue sequence depicting her encounter with willoughby was shot logistics were difficult as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day lee shot around fifty takes with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines this led to winslet eventually collapsing from hypothermia further problems occurred midway through filming when winslet contracted phlebitis in her leg developed a limp and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase\\nfrom may to july production took place at a number of other national trust estates and stately homes across england trafalgar house and wilton house in wiltshire stood in for the grounds of barton park and the london ballroom respectively mompesson house an eighteenthcentury townhouse located in salisbury represented mrs jennings sumptuous townhouse sixteenthcentury montacute house in somerset was the setting for the palmer estate of cleveland house further scenes were shot at compton castle in devon mr willoughbys estate and at the national maritime museum in greenwich\\nmusic\\ncomposer patrick doyle who had previously worked with his friend emma thompson in the films henry v much ado about nothing and dead again was hired to produce the music for sense and sensibility asked by the director to select existing music or compose new gentle melodies doyle wrote a score that reflected the films events he explained you had this middleclass english motif and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion doyle explains that the score becomes a little more grownup as the story progresses to one of maturity and an emotional catharsis the score contains romantic elements and has been described by national public radio as a restricted compass\\xa0 of emotion with instruments that blend together in a gentle sort of way they also noted that as a reflection of the story the score is a little wistful\\xa0 and sentimental\\ntwo songs are sung by marianne in the film with lyrics adapted from seventeenthcentury poems lee believed that the two songs conveyed the vision of duality visible both in the novel and script in his opinion the second song expressed mariannes mature acceptance intertwined with a sense of melancholy the melody of weep you no more sad fountains mariannes first song appears in the opening credits while her second songs melody features again during the ending credits this time sung by dramatic soprano jane eaglen the songs were written by doyle before filming began the composer received his first academy award nomination for his score\\nediting\\nthompson and doran discussed how much of the love stories to depict as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the dashwood sisters the screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads noting in her film production diary that such a decision would very much lie in the editing thompson wrote hundreds of different versions of romantic storylines she considered having edward reappear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as there was nothing for him to do thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between brandon and willoughby which is described in the novel because it only seemed to subtract from the mystery she and doran agonised about when and how to reveal brandons backstory as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored thompson described the process of reminding audiences of edward and brandon as keeping plates spinning\\na scene was shot of brandon finding his ward in a povertystricken area in london but this was excluded from the film thompsons script included a scene of elinor and edward kissing as the studio couldnt stand the idea of these two people who weve been watching all the way through not kissing it was one of the first scenes cut during editing the original version was over three hours lee was less interested in the storys romance and thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate the scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer thompson and doran also cut out a scene depicting willoughby as remorseful when marianne is sick doran said that despite it being one of the great scenes in book history they could not get it to fit into the film\\ntim squyres edited the film his fourth collaboration with ang lee he reflected in 2013 about the editing process\\nit was the first film that i had done with ang that was all in english and its emma thompson kate winslet alan rickman and hugh grant  these great great actors when you get footage like that you realise that your job is really not technical it was my job to look at something that emma thompson had done and say eh thats not good ill use this other one instead and not only was i allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors i was required to\\nthemes and analysis\\nchanges from source material\\nscholar louise flavin has noted that thompsons screenplay contains significant alterations to the characters of elinor and marianne dashwood in the novel the former embodies sense ie sensible in our terms and the latter sensibility ie sensitivity in our terms audience members are meant to view selfrestrained elinor as the person in need of reform rather than her impassioned sister to heighten the contrast between them marianne and willoughbys relationship includes an erotic invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair  a direct contrast to elinors reserved relationship with edward lee also distinguishes them through imagery  marianne is often seen with musical instruments near open windows and outside while elinor is pictured in door frames another character altered for modern viewers is margaret dashwood who conveys the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century thompson uses margaret for exposition in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs for instance elinor explains to a curious margaret  and by extension the audience  why their halfbrother inherits the dashwood estate margarets altered storyline giving her an interest in fencing and geography also allows audience members to see the feminine side of edward and brandon as they become father or brother figures to her the film omits the characters of lady middleton and her children as well as that of ann steele lucys sister\\nwhen adapting the characters for film thompson found that in the novel edward and brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods and that making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions several major male characters in sense and sensibility were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences grants edward and rickmans brandon are ideal modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as pleasing manners especially when contrasted with palmer thompsons script both expanded and omitted scenes from edwards storyline including the deletion of an early scene in which elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in edwards possession is hers when it belongs to lucy he was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers to gradually show viewers why brandon is worthy of mariannes love thompsons screenplay has his storyline mirroring willoughbys they are similar in appearance share a love of music and poetry and rescue marianne in the rain while on horseback\\nclass\\nthompson viewed the novel as a story of love and money noting that some people needed one more than the other during the writing process executive producer sydney pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences and that it be made clear why the dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job im from indiana if i get it everyone gets it he said thompson believed that austen was just as comprehensible in a different century you dont think people are still concerned with marriage money romance finding a partner she was keen to emphasise the realism of the dashwoods predicament in her screenplay and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences thompson made the dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament for instance because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants elinor is made to address a large group of servants at norland park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at barton cottage lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists lee conveys this in part when willoughby publicly rejects marianne he returns to a more lavishly furnished room a symbol of the wealth she has lost family dramas he stated are all about conflict about family obligations versus free will\\nthe films theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention carole dole noted that class constitutes an important element in austens stories and is impossible to avoid when adapting her novels according to dole lees film contains an ambiguous treatment of class values that stresses social differences but underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel for instance edwards story ends upon his proposal to elinor with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the vicarage louise flavin believed that lee used the houses to represent their occupants class and character the dashwood sisters decline in eligibility is represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of norland park and those of the isolated cramped barton cottage james thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised mlange of disconnected picture postcardgiftcalendarperfect scenes in which little connection is made between individual subjects and the land that supports them andrew higson argued that while sense and sensibility includes commentary on sex and gender it fails to pursue issues of class thompsons script he wrote displays a sense of impoverishment but is confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited dashwoods the broader class system is pretty much taken for granted the ending visual image of flying gold coins depicted during mariannes wedding has also drawn attention marsha mccreadie noted that it serves as a visual wrapup and emblem of the merger between money and marriage\\ngender\\ngender has been seen as another major theme of the film often intersecting with class penny gay observed that elinors early dialogue with edward about feeling idle and useless  with no hope whatsoever of any occupation reflected thompsons background as a middle class cambridgeeducated feminist conversely dole wrote that thompsons version of elinor has a surprising antifeminist element to it as she appears more dependent on men than the original character the film presents her as repressed resulting in her emotional breakdown with edward linda troost opined that lees production prominently features radical feminist and economic issues while paradoxically endorsing the conservative concept of marriage as a womans goal in life despite this mixed political agenda troost believed that the films faithfulness to the traditional heritage film genre is evident through its use of locations costumes and attention to details all of which also emphasize class and status gay and julianne pidduck stated that gender differences are expressed by showing the female characters indoors while their male counterparts are depicted outside confidently moving throughout the countryside nora stovel observed that thompson emphasises austens feminist satire on regency gender economics drawing attention not only to the financial plight of the dashwoods but also to eighteenthcentury women in general\\nmarketing and release\\nin the united states sony and columbia pictures released sense and sensibility on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films first premiering it on 13 december 1995 believing that a limited release would position the film both as an exclusive quality picture and increase its chances of winning academy awards columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the us it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned 721341 to benefit from the publicity surrounding potential academy award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations the film was released within oscar season the number of theatres showing sense and sensibility was slowly expanded with particular surges when its seven oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the ceremony in late march until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the us by the end of its american release sense and sensibility had been watched by more than eight million people garnering an impressive total domestic gross of 43182776\\non the basis of austens reputation as a serious author the producers were able to rely on highbrow publications to help market their film near the time of its us release large spreads in the new york review of books vanity fair film comment and other media outlets featured columns on lees production in late december time magazine declared it and persuasion to be the best films of 1995 andrew higson referred to all this media exposure as a marketing coup because it meant the film was reaching one of its target audiences meanwhile most promotional images featured the film as a sort of chick flick in period garb new market press published thompsons screenplay and film diary in its first printing the hard cover edition sold 28500 copies in the us british publisher bloomsbury released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures same title design and the casts names on the cover whilst signet publishing in the us printed 250000 copies instead of the typical 10000 a year actress julie christie read the novel in an audiobook released by penguin audiobooks sense and sensibility increased dramatically in terms of its book sales ultimately hitting tenth place on the new york times best seller list for paperbacks in february 1996\\nin the united kingdom sense and sensibility was released on 23 february 1996 in order to take advantage of the hype from pride and prejudice another popular austen adaptation recently broadcast columbia tristars head of uk marketing noted that if there was any territory this film was going to work it was in the uk after receiving positive responses at previews marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences attention was also paid to marketing sense and sensibility internationally because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being bigger than a normal british period drama literary film distributors avoided labelling it as just another english period film instead marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the daily mail which compared the film to four weddings and a funeral 1994 it was watched by more than ten million viewers in europe worldwide the film ultimately grossed 134582776 a sum that reflected its commercial success it had the largest box office gross out of the austen adaptations of the 1990s\\nreception\\ncritical response\\nsense and sensibility received overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics and was included on more than a hundred topten of the year lists on rotten tomatoes the film has a 97 approval rating based on 64 reviews with an average rating of 80010 the websites consensus reads sense and sensibility is an uncommonly deft very funny jane austen adaptation marked by emma thompsons finely tuned performance on metacritic the film has an average score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 reviews indicating universal acclaim audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film a grade a on scale of a to f\\nwriting for variety magazine todd mccarthy observed that the films success was assisted by its highly skilled cast of actors as well as its choice of lee as director mccarthy clarified although lees previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted lees achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of kazuo ishiguro writing the remains of the day\\nmick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle lauded the film for containing a sense of urgency that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal lasalle concluded that the adaptation has a right balance of irony and warmth the result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity filmed with an elegance that never calls attention to itself film critic john simon praised most of the film particularly focusing on thompsons performance though he criticised grant for being much too adorably bumbling\\xa0 he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona and stop hunching his shoulders like a dromedary other major critics such as lasalle roger ebert james berardinelli and janet maslin praised grants performance maslin wrote grant rises touchingly to the films most straightforward and meaningful encounters\\njarr carr of the boston globe thought that lee nailed austens acute social observation and tangy satire and viewed thompson and winslets age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility the radio times david parkinson was equally appreciative of lees direction writing that he avoids the chocolatebox visuals that cheapen so many british costume dramas and brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows emma thompsons respectful oscarwinning script to flourish\\nalthough as others have pointed out the adaption is not faithful to austens novel thompson plays fast and loose with austen cutting huge chunks out of the novel adding whole scenes a mere six or seven lines from the book actually make it into the film\\naccolades\\nout of the 1990s austen adaptations sense and sensibility received the most recognition from hollywood it garnered seven nominations at the 68th academy awards ceremony where thompson received the award for best screenplay based on material previously produced or published making her the only person to have won an oscar for both her writing and acting thompson won the best actress award for howards end in 1993 the film also was the recipient of twelve nominations at the 49th british academy film awards including best film best actress in a leading role for thompson and best actress in a supporting role for winslet in addition the film won the golden bear at the 46th berlin international film festival making lee the first director to win this twice\\ndespite the recognition given to the film lee was not nominated for the academy award for best director though he was nominated for the golden globe the scholar shumei shih and the journalist clarence page have attributed this snub to hollywoods racism against lee and chinese cinema in general lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the taiwan state media not to make it a national issue explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his countrys representative\\nlegacy and influence\\nfollowing the theatrical release of persuasion by a few months sense and sensibility was one of the first englishlanguage period adaptations of an austen novel to be released in cinemas in over fifty years the previous being the 1940 film pride and prejudice the year 1995 saw a resurgence of popularity for austens works as sense and sensibility and the serial pride and prejudice both rocketed to critical and financial success the two adaptations helped draw more attention to the previously littleknown 1995 television film persuasion and led to additional austen adaptations in the following years in 1995 and 1996 six austen adaptations were released onto film or television the filming of these productions led to a surge in popularity of many of the landmarks and locations depicted according to the scholar sue parrill they became instant meccas for viewers\\nwhen sense and sensibility was released in cinemas in the us town amp country published a sixpage article entitled jane austens england which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film a press book released by the studio as well as thompsons published screenplay and diaries listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism saltram house for instance was carefully promoted during the films release and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance in 1996 jasnas membership increased by fifty percent the popularity of both sense and sensibility and pride and prejudice led to the bbc and itv releasing their austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto dvd\\nas the mid1990s included adaptations of four austen novels there were few of her works to adapt andrew higson argues that this resulted in a variety of successors in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama as well as with films featuring strong female characters cited examples include mrs dalloway 1997 mrs brown 1997 shakespeare in love 1998 and bridget joness diary 2001 in 2008 andrew davies the screenwriter of pride and prejudice adapted sense and sensibility for television as a reaction to what he said was lees overly sentimental film this production features events found in the novel but excluded from thompsons screenplay such as willoughbys seduction of eliza and his duel with brandon it also features actors closer to the ages in the source material\\nsense and sensibility has maintained its popularity into the twentyfirst century in 2004 louise flavin referred to the 1995 film as the most popular of the austen film adaptations and in 2008 the independent ranked it as the thirdbest austen adaptation of all time opining that lee offered an acute outsiders insight into austen in this compelling 1995 interpretation of the book and emma thompson delivered a charming turn as the older wiser dashwood sister elinor journalist zoe williams credits thompson as the person most responsible for austens popularity explaining in 2007 that sense and sensibility is the definitive austen film and thats largely down to her in 2011 the guardian film critic paul laity named it his favourite film of all time partly because of its exceptional screenplay crisply and skilfully done devoney looser reflected on the film in the atlantic on the 20th anniversary of its release arguing that the film served as a turning point for profeminist masculinity in austen adaptations'}, {'title': 'Captain_Marvel_(film)', 'label': 'Film', 'text': 'captain marvel is a 2019

captain marvel later that year executive producer louis desposito said the studio was interested in a femaledriven superhero film and had plenty of strong female characters from which to choose suggesting captain marvel black widow pepper potts or peggy carter as possible candidates kevin feige president of marvel studios said that if marvel was to make a femaleled film he would prefer it to be a new character to the marvel cinematic universe like captain marvel for whom an origin story could be told in august 2014 feige stated that development had begun on a captain marvel film and said members of the public asked about the project more often than iron man 4 or \\nin october 2014 feige announced that captain marvel would be the studios first femaleled film and would focus on carol danvers it was given a release date of july 6 2018 as part of their slate of films feige said the film had been in development almost as long as guardians of the galaxy 2014 and doctor strange 2016 and one of its biggest challenges would be balancing the title characters earthbound adventures with her cosmic powers he said a writer and director for the film would be announced soon and female filmmakers were being considered for the project but he could not promise that filmmakers from a certain demographic would be hired for the film\\nin february 2015 marvel pushed the release date back to november 2 2018 to accommodate  2017 in early april feige revealed that captain marvel had been included in an early draft of the  2015 screenplay but marvel chose to remove this appearance because they did not want to introduce the character before they were able to explore her backstory and personality first he also said that marvel would announce writers for the film within a few weeks and by midapril guardians of the galaxy coscreenwriter nicole perlman and inside out 2015 coscreenwriter meg lefauve were announced to be writing the screenplay the duo were put together as a writing team after impressing feige with separate takes on the character and began work on the film within a month lefauve found the character being a female superhero to be both wonderful and a challenge believing that the characters powerlevel could lead to the superman curse of being perceived to be invulnerable additionally lefauve and perlman found that writing a story about a human and not getting too overwhelmed by the worry of representing all women worked best when approaching the story an article about young girls who would quit learning to code after they encountered trouble made lefauve and perlman consider questions about females being taught they cannot make mistakes or embrace their own power this helped the duo realize that part of embracing your power is failure and seeing it more as feedback instead of your character\\nby may marvel had discussions with ava duvernay about directing captain marvel or black panther 2018 which feige confirmed a month later saying that he had met with duvernay amongst a number of other directors and expected a decision to be made by mid to late 2015 that september feige said that the casting process would not begin until 2016 as the studio did not want to try to cast carol danvers until they had decided on the direction for the character in the screenplay as well as the structure of the film and the characters role in the rest of marvels phase three films producer jeremy latcham elaborated that getting the character right first is going to lead the charge in october 2015 marvel changed the release date again this time moving it to march 8 2019 to make room for antman and the wasp 2018\\nfeige stated in april 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid2016 he also mentioned that the film would be about carol danvers becoming captain marvel the next month indie filmmaker emily carmichaels name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film and by june brie larson emerged as the frontrunner to play captain marvel larsons casting was confirmed at the 2016 san diego comiccon she was set to earn 5\\xa0million for the film larson was initially hesitant to accept the role but couldnt deny the fact that this movie is everything i care about everything thats progressive and important and meaningful and a symbol i wished i wouldve had growing up she was able to bring to the part some of those deep emotional things she had used in previous more dramatic roles larson felt this would differentiate captain marvel from other superhero films also at comiccon feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates and he hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months\\nperlman revealed in august that the characters origin story had been changed for the film because of similarities to the dc comics character green lantern with feige explaining that the new story is centered on danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities he added that danvers is the most powerful character in the mcu and would become very important in the franchise producer nate moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many mcu origin stories which he described as a character having a problem before gaining powers at the end of the first act and the end of the second act they learn about the powers the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers instead danvers starts the film having already gained her powers\\nin october 2016 feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the films story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a great version of the film but it was something that marvel felt was important to consider even if that female filmmaker did not know a lot about the comics as they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it its amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through the source material and know oh a females writing it now speaking in particular to kelly sue deconnicks run in the comics feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016 however perlman and lefauve turned in a script treatment around december pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017\\nin february 2017 perlman stated that despite her and lefauve being hired almost a year previously the duo had only recently gotten their marching orders for the script stating that one of the reasons for the

because of its chronic shortage of manpower the law of 1792 which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the army became the united states armys official policy until 1862 the only exception to this army policy was louisiana which gained an exemption at the time of its purchase through a treaty provision which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law which ran counter to its traditions and customs louisiana permitted the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks\\na militia unit in louisiana the 2nd battalion of free men of color

man the defenses at baltimore in his 1837 memoir ball reflected on the battle of bladensburg i stood at my gun until the commodore was shot down if the militia regiments that lay upon our right and left cold have been brought to charge the british in close fight as they crossed the bridge we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs barneys flotilla group included numerous african americans who provided artillery support during the battle modern scholars estimate blacks made up between 15 and 20 of the american naval forces in the war of 1812\\njust before the battle commodore barney on being asked by president james madison if his negroes would not run on the approach of the british replied no sirthey dont know how to

and the uss columbus\\nthe involvement of african americans in this war was one where they were not included as actual soldiers there were however a few cases of african americans joining in the fighting and these people became known as black toms many slaves that were brought into assist the army officers escaped to mexico however whenever the american army would encounter these african americans they viewed them as stolen property and dissolved them back into the racial hierarchy of the army\\namerican civil war\\nthe history of african americans in the us civil war is marked by 186097 7122 officers 178975 enlisted africanamerican men comprising 163 units who served in the union army during the civil war and many more african americans served in the union navy both free african americans and runaway slaves joined the fight\\non the confederate side blacks both free and slave were used for labor in the final months of the war the confederate army was desperate for additional soldiers so the confederate congress voted to recruit black troops for combat they were to be promised their freedom units were in training when the war ended and none served in combat\\nindian wars\\nfrom 1863 to the early 20th century africanamerican units were utilized by the army to combat the native americans during the indian wars the most noted among this group were the buffalo soldiers\\nat the end of the us civil war the army reorganized and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry the 9th and 10th us cavalry four regiments of infantry the 38th 39th 40th and 41st us infantry were formed at the same time in 1869 the four infantry regiments were merged into two new ones the 24th and 25th us infantry these units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by white officers such as benjamin grierson and occasionally an africanamerican officer such as henry o flipper the buffalo soldiers served a variety of roles along the frontier from building roads to guarding the us mail\\nthese regiments served at a variety of posts in the southwest united states and great plains regions during this period they participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the medal of honor during the indian wars\\nspanishamerican war\\nafter the indian wars ended in the 1890s the regiments continued to serve and participated in the spanishamerican war including the battle of san juan hill where five more medals of honor were

philippines became a colony of the united states when the us military started to send soldiers into the islands native rebels who had already been fighting their former spanish rulers opposed us colonization and retaliated causing an insurrection in what would be known as the philippineamerican war the us military also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection however due to the discrimination of africanamerican soldiers some of them defected to the philippine army\\none of those that defected was david fagen who was given the rank of captain in the philippine army fagen served in the 24th regiment of the us army but on november 17 1899 he defected to the filipino army he became a successful guerrilla leader and his capture became an obsession to the us military and american public his defection was likely the result of differential treatment by american occupational forces toward black soldiers as well as common american forces derogatory treatment and views of the filipino occupational resistance who were frequently referred to as niggers and gugus\\nafter two other black deserters were captured and executed president theodore roosevelt announced he would stop executing captured deserters as the war ended the us gave amnesties to most of their opponents a substantial reward was offered for fagen who was considered a traitor there are two conflicting versions of his fate one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains\\nworld war i and interwar period\\nwhen the war broke out several africanamericans joined allied armies most notably eugene bullard and bob scanlon joined the french foreign legion within weeks of the start of the war of the twelve africanamericans who joined the legion at the start only two survived the war\\nthe us armed forces remained segregated through world war i as a matter of policy and practice and despite the effort of black leadership to overcome that discrimination the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp had been formed in 1909 to move black equality of opportunity forward but with the declaration of war in 1917 civil rights leader web du bois declared an acceptable fallback in the effort first your country then your rights became the naacp slogan\\nthe optimistic belief was that by serving valiantly in the nations war effort blacks would gain the respect and equality that had been elusive thus far but it was pitted against an underlying unwillingness by the war department to become a vehicle for social change secretary of war newton d baker had made it clear that though african americans would be fairly treated in the military the department could not undertake at this time to settle the socalled race question instead the practices that limited equality and opportunity in civilian society were carried over to military society\\nprospective black enlistees in the war effort were turned away in large part because there were not enough segregated black units to take them in those blacks who were successfully enlisted were kept in the same restricted channels of their civil lives segregated transportation took them to segregated military bases and regiments that were rarely deployed to much more than the tasks of support and maintenance and in those jobs they were subject to treatment of indignities by white officers such as eating in the rain having no facilities to wash clothes or bath no toilets and sleeping in tents with no floors still many african americans volunteered to join the military following americas entry into the war by the time of the armistice with germany on november 11 1918 over 200000 african americans had served with the american expeditionary force on the western front while 170000 remained in the united states\\nthough most africanamerican units were largely relegated to support roles and did not see combat some african americans played a notable role in americas war effort for example the 369th infantry regiment known as the harlem hellfighters was assigned to the french army and served on the front lines for six months 171 members of the 369th were awarded the legion of merit\\ngermany attempted to sway the african american troops with propaganda challenging their racerelated rights back in the united states\\ncorporal freddie stowers of the 371st infantry regiment that was seconded to the 157th french army division called the red hand division in need of reinforcement under the command of the general mariano goybet was posthumously awarded a medal of honorthe only african american to be so honored for actions in world war i during action in france stowers had led an assault on german trenches continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded stowers died from his wounds but his men continued the fight and eventually defeated the german troops stowers was recommended for the medal of honor shortly after his death but the nomination was according to the army misplaced in 1990 under pressure from congress the department of the army launched an investigation based on findings from this investigation the army decorations board approved the award of the medal of honor to stowers  on april 24 199173 years after he was killed in actionstowers two surviving sisters received the medal of honor from president george h w bush at the white house the success of the investigation leading to stowers medal of

returned home from world war i and many african american veterans were lynched after returning from wwi the prediction of equality by web du bois and the naacp would not be realized and racial antagonism was expanded by the claims that any talk of black valor and positive contribution were lies meant to cover up cowardice and incompetence which was counteracted by claims of prejudiced and harmful white leadership and the use of blacks as cannon fodder for white troops that followed them into combat\\nexperience of soldiers in france\\nafrican americans were typically placed into labour battalions with around 160000 of the 200000 african americans who were shipped out to france in 1917 finding themselves placed in one these labour battalions were viewed as being the dregs of the military forces and the men in them were driven to the brink of physical and emotional exhaustion jim crow was extended to the camps where the african american soldiers were stationed and white officers would frequently remind african american soldiers of this the 370th infantry regiment were informed a black member of a labour battalion had recently been hanged in the same square the unit was now assembling in a small town outside the lorraine region\\nin support of an attempt to impose american racial policy on france an extraordinary memo was received by the mayors of the meuse division upon the arrival of the african american 372nd infantry regiment the red hand in 1918 it asked that the french not complicate the life from which the soldiers had come in america by integrating with them socially\\nthe question is of great importance to the french people and even more so to the american towns the population of which will be affected later when the troops return to the united states it therefore becomes necessary for both the colored and white races that undo mixing of these two be circumspectly prevented \\nthe request was not generally honored by the french\\nthe way in which they were treated by white americans in france created a stark contrast between the way in which they were treated by french troops and civilians who treated them more like equals the result of this contrast was mass disillusionment amongst the african american soldiers which was something many carried with them when they returned home from the war\\nafrican american soldiers interacted with colonial troops stationed in france they had already read about them in african american newspapers the french military had reframed the debate for african americans at home france saw black people as having an important combatant role in the defence of the nation these stories and experiences fuelled african american racial pride which contributed to their mass disillusionment when returning home\\nymca services in france were also segregated sixty african american ysecretaries among them twentythree african american women served the 200000 black soldiers

chad l williams african american soldiers experiences in the war and their battles with the pervasive racial discrimination in the us military informed their postwar disillusionment and subsequent racial militancy as veterans examples of this racial militancy can be seen in the prominent roles which some african american wwi veterans played in the civil rights movement for example william n colston an african american veteran who had served in the 367th infantry during the war published several essays in the uss leading radical african american magazine the messenger these articles aimed to illustrate the experiences which african americans soldiers had throughout the war african americans wartime experiences also played a key role in the formation of the league for democracy which

africanamerican sailors who refused to continue loading ammunition under the same dangerous conditions the trial was observed by the then young lawyer thurgood marshall and ended in conviction of all

notable africanamerican military members or units in popular culture'}, {'title': 'To_Fly!', 'label': 'Film', 'text': 'to fly is a 1976 american short docufiction film by greg macgillivray and jim freeman of macgillivray freeman films as the premiere film of the national air and space museum nasm imax theater opened for the museums current building celebrating the united states bicentennial it chronicles the history of aviation in the country and how the american imagination helped it revolutionize humanity with a narration written by thomas mcgrath the film explores themes of finding national identity and humans innate relationship with aviation\\nthe idea of the film dates back to 1970 and was revisited four years later following thennasm director michael collins interest in an imax theater macgillivray and freeman expanded the story of to fly treatment given by the smithsonian institution and francis thompson inc from a draft by the latter by infusing humor to tell audiences that the film is not littered with technical jargon as instructed by collins due to imaxs giantscreen nature several filmmaking rules and techniques were implemented for immersion and clarity the three cameras were rigorously modified to fit with macgillivray and freemans intentions creation of the ending space sequence prompted experimentations due to the limits of the imax cameras and format the film was edited by macgillivray and freeman themselves while the score was composed by bernardo segall though over a year in the making and with a rough production the film had a relatively low budget and was finished on schedule\\nto fly was released on july 1 1976 like other bicentennial films it was initially scheduled for only a year of screening however as popularity surged public outcry prompted everlasting screening it was later released in nonimax formats and on home media a 20thanniversary special edition was later released in 1996 the film was deemed significant for introducing a vast audience to the thennew format and its influence was acknowledged by imax filmmakers alike making it inducted into the national film registry and the imax hall of fame it also set macgillivray as a major imax filmmaker amassing a large following and notable in its role to the growing popularity of museum imax theaters it remained the highestgrossing giantscreen documentary for a long period and broke various other records to fly received universal critical and audience acclaim particularly for its cinematography editing and narrative hailed a washingtonian icon and received various accolades\\nsummary\\nto fly runs 27 minutes it begins on july 4 1831 in craftsbury vermont where fictional hotair balloonist ezekiel after reciting his patriotic quatrain declaring himself a pioneer ascends on a voyage around new england everyone below looks at the hotairballoon in awe and surprise at its magnificence ezekiel sees a canoeist heading for whitewater at horseshoe falls and yells get to shore the canoeist immediately obliges before he could reach the rapid\\nthe film then chronicles the history of aviation beginning with hotairballoons it says that the newfound vertical angle of the world was like the opening of a new eye allowing humans to reach places previously untouched and extend the human limits an act once considered godlike the desire to fly also inspired the creation of skyscrapers although hotairballoons were revolutionary the majority of americans still used horses thanks to the human imagination the faster trains were invented then the more accessible cars mechanical aircraft was later invented unlike the balloon there are more controls the roaring twenties saw the invention of barnstorming cited to further access to aviation among americans military aviation was later invented which formed flight demonstration squadrons like the blue angels with airlines flying became a travel medium and access to the american territory expands westward beyond the mainland after widebody aircraft ultralight aviation was invented\\nto fly ends with the launch of the saturn ib in the apollosoyuz mission at the kennedy space center on july 15 1975 after dubbing spaceflight a historical feat the narration existentially suggests that it can be used to discover extraterrestrial life and uses it to depict the human imagination as limitless which is credited to the philosophical awakening given by the vertical view of the world accompanied by a view of earth the film ends with the narrationwe have come a long way from a time when people gazed enviously upon the birds inflight today we look upon our planet from afar and feel a new tenderness for the tiny and fragile earth for we know now that even as we walk upon the ground we are ever inflight through the universe and so we begin to realize that human destiny has ever been and always must be to fly\\nproduction\\ndevelopment and writing\\nthe 1960s and 1970s were periods that saw increasing numbers of museum theaters as part of the effort to modernize museums with audiovisual content the idea of a giantscreen theater at the national air and space museum nasm itself dates back to 1970 in a 153page report by the national museum of natural history nmnh curator team which argues that the nasm needs a contemporary medium of communications that will resonate intellectually and psychologically the report suggested a giantscreen experiential film that would showcase the american landscape and the countrys introduction to technology ending with predictions of the countrys future with the availability of technology the nmnh later proposed a panoramic curved imax screen at the nmnhs rotunda but it was later discarded\\nin 1974 when hearing that the smithsonian institution will open the new building of the nasm at the national mall in washington dc as part of the united states us bicentennial filmmaker and imax corporation founder graeme ferguson proposed to thendirector of the museum astronaut michael collins to open an imax theater as he believed it would be a big contribution to the museum collins had not seen an imax film and was not convinced at the time however when he went to expo 74 to give a speech an imax representative coaxed him to go to the events own imax theater and see man belongs to the earth a 23minute environmentalist documentary film collins immediately expressed interest in building an imax theater convinced that the experience would provide a sense of realism to visitors this would make the nasm the first museum to have an imax theater it was supported by thendeputy director melvin b zisfein who then made two film treatments both of which were later discarded and replaced with a third one the first treatment the beautiful mysteries of flight conceptualizes an aestheticcentric film about the wonderous mysterious nature of aviation with hope that when audiences leave the theater and look at the exhibits an amplified sense of wonder would be created despite being discarded the two treatments had major influences on the third\\non july 1 giantscreen filmmaker francis thompson proposed to them a film about the history of flight for them to play as part of the bicentennial and as their theaters premiere film with a us750000 budget from conoco inc they set the projects deadline to 1976 conoco helped fund the project as a bicentennial gift to the nasm it was owned by dupont who has significant work on aeronautics after writing the third treatment with francis thompson inc credited as production and consultant company the smithsonian later commissioned filmmakers greg macgillivray and james jim freeman to make the film the duo assumed the smithsonian knew them from jonathan livingston seagull 1973 which they cofilmed and received an academy award for best cinematography nomination as well as from the towering inferno 1974 whose aerial shots were filmed by them and became a boxoffice success they had known imax from reading monthly technology journals and were delighted of the commission collins told macgillivray and freeman he did not want the film to be too historyoriented i have plenty of historical plaques on the wall of my museum please give me a film that entertains and allows the audience to be amazed by flight macgillivray praised collins for giving him full creative freedom\\ncollins and zisfein also gave a list of suggestions 20 of which were fulfilled macgillivray and freeman deemed the given treatment not perfect enough and expanded into a chronological story that contained humor comical fictitious characters and  a little bit of flight history they also took some inspiration from their previous surf films as well as their experience with aerial filmmaking they analyzed 12 imax films for inspiration and reference the first being man belongs to the earth whose opening aerial shot of the grand canyon made them really pumped they observed how those 12 films vary in genre from fiction documentaries to comedy and wrote to fly so that it would be a mix of them giving audiences a compact definition of imax the opening scene is humorous so that audiences can relax and laugh arguing that the purely factual nature of the nasm will come off as a dry historical drama on film thompson agreed with this decision saying that there are enough factbased bicentennial films and that people need more entertainment macgillivray said that imax is perfect for the film as it allows myself as a filmmaker to impact the audience in a greater way he also called it a coincidence because the film depicts aviation when it was brandnew and that imax was a brandnew product\\nwhile there is no extensive cast list actress ellen bry played an unnamed role credited writers include thompson robert m young and arthur zegart thomas mcgrath wrote the narration researching was also done throughout preproduction it overall took around seven months collins physicist jeffrey kirsch astronomer paul knappenberger as well as aviators walter j boyne and donald s lopez sr helped with the process freemans girlfriend cindy huston was the camera assistant macgillivrays thengirlfriend nowwife barbara smith was the production assistant craft service specialist still photographer and behind the scenes cinematographer bill bennett and jeff blyth were the production managers brad ohlund is the second assistant camera and phil schwartz was the first other credits include byron mckinney as executive producer elizabeth howell as secretary and bookkeeper rae troutman as grip brad ohlund as assistant grip and john divers as storyboard developer television documentarian and historian jon wilkman was also briefly involved in preproduction nasa the office of naval research and california institute of technology were also involved in the production according to macgillivray to fly is the best film he and freeman worked on together for over 11 years\\nfilming\\nmacgillivray and freeman directed and filmed to fly with them switching roles constantly principal photography occurred for a period of five months throughout 1975 with a pause in june to film the action sequences of sky riders 1976 they worked extensively seven days a week and 14 hours a day from 5am to 9pm their filming budget us590000 was relatively small but did not disturb the production in any way it also prompted a storyboard using that and the script he and freeman made various ways selfcoined imax moments to thrill the imax audiences and to rely on visuals more instead of narration each scene was planned to fit with the imax format a version of the storyboard was colored to avoid miscommunications among clients postfilming as firm believers of filmmaking as a collaboration macgillivray and freeman were also open with the crew allowing creative suggestions from them\\nat the time there was only one line of imax cameras which are heavy weighing  and have low specifications dismaying the filmmakers who wanted to fly to be an imax gamechanger additionally they were worried of damaging that one and only camera model they were able to get and also wanted to minimize the need for retaking should it be needed ferguson and fellow imax cofounders bill shaw and robert kerr were proposed to produce three new cameras with detailed higher specifications macgillivray also said that the cameras will also be used for american years a 50minute epic imax film for the temporary philadelphia 76 theater also a bicentennial celebration ferguson granted the proposal with glee however while filming to fly there was a scene using the second camera that required filming from a parachute but the parachute did not deploy and the camera was destroyed\\nbecause of the nature of imax a new set of filming rules were abided and many conventional rules ignored it took three months to test the cameras and other equipment to ensure production will run flawlessly to make the film bright colorful and naturalistic they used the 65mm film stock eastman color negative 5254 and merely used a standard tiffen 85 filter the short duration was cited to the high cost of the film stock to have a dramatic look they used cross and crossback lighting the thennew oconnor 150 tripod head was used due to its ability to withstand the heavy cameras because the imax screen is enormous the audiences sits relatively close to the screen and the new center lies approximately onethird up from the bottom of the screen thus extremelong shots were treated as wideangle shots while the latter was treated as normal shots condensed movement was used to switch between an extreme long shot to medium closeup and a wideangle lens was used to further expand the films view according to macgillivray plenty of headroom is needed in all closeups in imax the medium closeup so the audience can establish comfortable eyecontact camera lenses were also carefully picked a scene with a vertical view of new york city used a 30mm fisheye lens giving it edge curvature and image distortion for lenses specifically built for hasselblad cameras shutters were removed and the mounts were modified in order to fit in the imax cameras and the focal lengths were changed from 30mm to 60mm amid filming the film crew wished they had a zoom lens that could have eased some of the filming they used the first imax zoom lens in their later film behold hawaii 1983\\nmany shots in the film took a long time to prepare for example a 35second shot of the blue angels speeding over the colorado river and yuma desert took over four months to choreograph macgillivray described it as timeconsuming camera mounts were designed by the united states navy usn for a mcdonnell douglas f4 phantom ii used to film the scene despite lack of confidence that it will work successfully fellow friend nelson tyler managed to spend two months developing two mounts for the camera helicopters one to film forwardmoving shots and another equipped with a camera dolly to film from the side that allow smooth aerial shots remotecontrolled devices were also built to move the second mount the helicopters were piloted by george nolan chuck phillips and adrian brooks mounts were also by boeing for the boeing 747 as well as on art scholls super chipmunk aircraft which was used to film front pointofviews the mounts took weeks to test so that the camera can stay intact without even a bit of vibration the hotairballoon aerial scenes were filmed from a helicopter reallife expert balloonist peter walker was chosen to play the role of ezekiel because during the colonial times hotairballoons were powered by helium the usn donated free helium for the film crew as a gift because of the blue angels presence in the film\\naerial work platforms were used to support the balloon basket as well as the camera the former was supported by two platforms as it moved in opposing directions to heighten the illusion of actual inflight motion to create a scene where a 1891 sierra no 3 locomotive hits the screen the film crew placed a mirror at the end of the track then point the wideangle camera sideways to point to the mirror for a symmetrical view of the rail as the locomotive approaches and shatters the mirror for shots featuring closeups of the pilots flying the air vehicles the illusion was made by filming with the sky in the background while the aircrafts engines rev and the camera moves in and out of a rough dolly bob wills also flew the kauai coastline hangglider one of the scenes suggested by collins and zisfein during a period where the sport saw spiking popularity a stagecoach was used in a scene where it races with the locomotive prior to that scene a conestoga wagon is depicted the 747 aerial scene was filmed from a 737 donated by boeing a curtiss model d was flown by frank tallman for the mechanical flight sequence a ford flivver was used in a segue between the car and mechanical flight scene this was done by a low shot accelerating with audiences assuming this is the car but to their surprise it flies beyond the ground above coastal california other filming locations include the gateway arch lake powell monument valley and yosemite falls the barnstorming scene was filmed in california there was a deleted scene in the opening sequence where the crowd witnessing ezekiels ascent perform barn raising\\nfilming ended on schedule despite all the technical challenges faced macgillivray largely credited this to the extensive preparation done preproduction\\nspace sequence\\nthe space sequence begins with the launch of the saturn ib rocket they were given special permission to film it marking the first time a rocket launch was filmed on imax the film crew took this part of the production more seriously as it cannot be repeated unlike the other parts of production despite their equal level of difficulty as they left the camera outside for a day humidity causes the camera to become condensed this was exacerbated by seasonal thunderstorms despite their best efforts the camera was later found wet and jammed and they immediately cleaned and lubricated it for around three hours they managed to catch the launch on film despite initial uncertainty\\nwith such a low budget the film crew initially conceived the space sequence as merely a compilation of astronomical images but realized they needed some kind of movement for a giantscreen film and thus saved money on the liveaction filming so that a better space sequence can be created they expected to fly to be compared with the cinerama classic  1968 and despite their limited resources try to make the space sequence as reminiscent of the film as possible when reading about the films production they learned that something small like stars on an imax presentation is nothing on a traditional presentation after some difficulty they managed to create the stars on a kodalith negative sheet film another thing they learned from 2001 a space odyssey was that movement is important the imax nature meant that they could only film the space sequence at six and 12 frames per second and that stop motion technique is impossible additional limitations prompted detailed communication with the nasm to help assist the production george casey and lester novros of graphic films provided planetary models and studio facilities for scenes that require them as well as using their expertise to ease the production\\nin a scene where the spaceship passes jupiter and io they filmed separate elements in separate film rolls each required four separate passes of the negative through the camera each time being rewound to heads and rethreaded to a common start frame the camera was placed on a motorized dolly they filmed io first then jupiter then the spaceship according to blyth the spaceship was a transparency of a starship model rearlighted on a stationary glass frame macgillivray and freeman constructed it and blyth designed it to have the same color palette as the 747 the starships components were based on thenfuture ideas about propulsion systems like advanced ion thrusters as well as magnetically confined fusions like deuterium3 and helium3 overall models took 150 hours to create the scene featuring the dark earth and a horizon sunrise used a dolly some scenes including a saturn scene was filmed at a homemade animation stand others used a pseudo version of the slitscan photography kit used for 2001 a space odyssey a modified auxiliary peg bar was used to attach the models the glass sheet with the starship was suspended nearby the bar several motors and control devices were tried to film the extremely slow scenes and the zoom motors were determined to work the best to add movement to the shots a geared head and a custom gear operated by the zoom motor were used creating a slight pan they filmed all these scenes on 16mm first to make sure they were replicable on imax collins assisted this entire segment of production to ensure realism\\nthe penultimate set of shots of nebulae used bellows and hasselblad closeup lens the camera facing a waterfilled tray the nebulae were a mixture of jet black ink and white enamel paint with color coming from the gelled lighting the materials temperature thickness size and type had to be precise and same to achieve the reaction since they had to film at 96 fps two solutions were most implemented to slow down the movement pouring mineral oil and applying paint thinner to the tray the latter was favored as it created more interesting movements akin to threedimensional effect often a small wire was shaped and dipped into the tray to create specific patterns special effects designers jim palmer and barney kaelin created the laser beam effects they had experimented with various types of patterns preproduction\\noverall the space sequence took 4 months to prepare test and film\\npostproduction\\nto fly was edited by macgillivray and freeman himself with alexander hammid supervising on a moviola knowing that they would experiment on different editing styles the films shots were directed beforehand so that it would allow them to do so pacing is normal so that audiences have enough time to explore the entirety of the shots in the opening the part where ezekiel is still at land merely uses 16th of the imax surface as he ascends all of the screen is utilized this is to give a dramatic sense to the film as well as a reference to aviation which the film calls like the opening of a new eye that idea whose goal was to give audiences a good impression of imax was taken from the similarly styled opening sequence of this is cinerama 1952 multiscreen imagesthe act of placing duplicates of images in the same screen were occasionally done inspired by the multiprojector film labyrinth 1967 and the first imax film tiger child 1970 there is a blue angels scene where the screen proportionally divides into 36 all featuring the same shot after learning that an inconsideratelyplaced multiscreen scene would create a confusing experience for audiences jim liles of the optical department at metrogoldwynmayer and filmmaker dennis earl moore designed new mattes where the bottom row is 15 larger than the top allowing for clearer focus of attention smith supervised research for the stock footage to be incorporated into the multiscreen scenes and handpicked footages shot by macgillivray himself after editing a cinemeccanica norelco aaii 35mm70mm projector was installed at their studio and sat relatively close to the screen to get a feel of what to fly would look like on imax overall editing took four months\\nmacgillivray considers to fly an audiovisual voyage through time and thus wanted the best person to compose the film score eventually it was composed and conducted by bernardo segall and performed by the most professional and experienced symphonic 49piece orchestra in california at the burbank studios segall was chosen because he was considered a great classical composer whose works have an air of sophistication and elegance which would maintain the steady rhythm and pulse of the film the score was the first in history to use a keyed bugle which is also depicted in the films opening sequence during the gathering for ezekiels ascent a small fanfare team plays a fife drum clarinet and b keyed bugle the score was later edited by richard r mccurdy and mixed by dan wallin the latter was assisted by paul martin the score was recorded on a 16track recorder which was then mixed down to three out of the six channels at the 35mm fullcoat sprocketed magnetic film it was mixed authentically to create a quadrophonic surround experience toddaos los angeles mixing facility in hollywood was also used for postproduction joseph ellison later the creator of dont go in the house 1980 participated in this segment for the sound effects sam shaw was the editor while ray west and jack woltz were mixers because of imaxs high audio technology certain scenes in the film were made just for the audio experience for example a multiscreen scene where two jets cross each other which exploits the surround nature of the sound system macgillivray expected audience to shiver in this scene due to the dramatic shift of attention another example is in a scene where the locomotive hits the screen the engine noises went from the center to all around the audience\\nclients applauded the rough cut two of the biggest the smithsonian and conoco gave various inputs for the final cut conoco later became the films sponsor the whole postproduction process combined with the space sequence production took a total of six months\\nthemes and style\\nto fly contains themes of how the imaginations of the american people helped pioneer aviation and how the aerial sceneries further inspired them to improve aviation and revolutionized the world this is proven by the many aircraft shots backdropped with the countrys landscapes critic daniel eagan opined that the majority of the point of views depicted in the films opening sequence are stately processional celebrating the american landscape while remaining distant from it from there the film explores the country igniting patriotic empathy it was also viewed as a nationalist film linking the american quest for national identity to the development of aviation through metanarratives as well as the linear westward progress of aviation though its visual rhetoric only shines in the space sequence the smithsonian in reference to the final narration of the film said that its theme is flight in all its forms is part of the human condition part of our destiny\\ncollins said that the films style makes it a break from the learning going on in the rest of the museum and nasm former assistant leroy london alongside thenchief of presentations and education von del chamberlain said it is an amplification of the fascination or interest of flying within visitors after seeing all the exhibits in the museum film author alison griffiths argued that the film is an addon to a museum admission where the exhibits give visitors information and interest the film gives them a specific sense of wonder exhibits may fail to provide steve mckerrow of the baltimore sun noted how certain scenes are tributes to cinematic history the shot where the train hits the camera is similar to one from the great train robbery 1903 the hotairballoon scenes are reminiscent of around the world in 80 days 1956 and the barnstorming scene is probably set in the same field in north by northwest 1959 in a crop duster chase scene the film has been categorized a travelogue of the us which is compared to the closing section of this is cinerama which has a similar narrative\\nrelease\\npress announcements of to fly date back to may 16 1976 and earlier on june 24 there was a preview of the film at the nasms samuel p langley imax theater renamed lockheed martin in 2002 it was later released at langley theater on july 1 1976 to packed audiences it was labeled a public service by conoco who was also distributor lawrence associates was codistributor macgillivray assisted the theninexperienced projectionists and frequently visited the projection booth to ensure the film roll is in good condition pachelbels canon in d was the music that played as audiences enter the theater a decision praised as memorable relaxing religiously experiential and meaningful the music has been interpreted as about humans quest to fly aligning with the very film it is accompanied by all earnings of the film accrued to theater maintenance and financing future imax productions after september 6 labor day conoco began distributing the film to schools organizations and nonimax theaters like other bicentennial films to fly was scheduled for a oneyear run but the revelation of this was met with public outcry and the nasm decided to keep the film in the 1990s they decided to upgrade the sound system to digital rejuvenating the films glory and also release the film in digital projection at times there were about 14 showtimes every day\\nhowever freeman aged 32 was killed in a helicopter crash at the sierra nevada two days prior to release while finding locations for a kodak commercial griefstricken macgillivray doubted he could ever continue filmmaking as he and freeman were very close friends but he coped with it keeping the production companys name macgillivray freeman films mff as a tribute the tragedy also makes to fly freemans swan song a 20thanniversary special edition was screened in 1996 which used a new version of score an example of the alteration is in the theme music where a masculine chant of the melody was added and a shot of a vast forest whose score has a feminine sigh as the expanse is revealed to mark the films 35th anniversary it was screened at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children the same price used until the 1980s this often switched with us1 for adults and 50 cents for children airbus imax theater

only five in the us the smithsonian later also built an imax theater named after samuel c johnson at the nmnh museums went crazy over the film specifically the transformative opening sequence michael kernan of the washington post credited word of mouth to the popularity as marketing was limited to brochures and newspaper ads as well as tv spots by theaters macgillivray did not expect such milestone and credited freemans talent to the success screening film formats include but not limited to 16mm 15 perforations70mm 870mm omninaxcustomized 1570mm and imax 4k laser for the first 15

considered for the role in the 2006 film superman returns but lost to brandon routh cavill stated theres a very real story behind the superman character he explained that everyones goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identitiesincluding his birth name kalel and his alter ego clark kent cavill also stated that hes alone and theres no one like him referring to supermans vulnerabilities that must be incredibly scary and lonely not to know who you are or what you are and trying to find out what makes sense wheres your baseline what do you draw from where do you draw a limit with the power you have in itself thats an incredible weakness in an interview with total film magazine cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5000 calories a day training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass cooper timberline was cast as the 9yearold clark kent and dylan sprayberry was cast as the 13yearold clark

there was a big giant search for lois snyder said for us it was a big thing and obviously a really important role we did a lot of auditioning but we had this meeting with amy adams and after that i just felt she was perfect for it adams auditioned for the role three times once for the unproduced superman flyby and the second time for superman returns before landing the current role adams was confirmed to play lois lane in march 2011 while announcing the role snyder said in a statement we are excited to announce the casting of amy adams one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about lois smart tough funny warm ambitious and of course beautiful on portraying lois lane adams stated that the film would feature a lois lane who is an independent feisty woman  but set in a more identifiable world adams said that she has become more of a freeranging journalist someone who likes to be handson the nature of the newspaper business has changed so much there is so much more pressure\\na kryptonian general with the same superpowers as superman bent on transforming earth into a new krypton under his reign viggo mortensen and daniel daylewis were also considered for the role snyder stated zod is not only one of supermans most formidable enemies but one of the most significant because he has insights into superman that others dont michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character making him perfect for the role when goyer was asked about why zod was chosen as the villain he stated the way christopher nolan and i have always approached movies as well is you never say hey which villain would be cool for this movie you start with the story first what kind of story what kind of theme do you want to tell so we worked that out then usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of whos going to be the appropriate antagonist for that when you guys see the movie the only villain we couldve used was zod and the kryptonians i mean when you see what the whole story is nothing else would have even made sense\\nclarks adoptive father snyder explained his reason for his casting the onscreen couple is solely for the realism i think the thing you realize when you look at diane and kevin in our decision to cast them so far you sort of get a sense of how tonally were looking at the movie and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors and were taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys youre talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is our first priority is to make sure its rendered in the most realistic way we can get at\\nclarks adoptive mother lane was the first cast member to join the film after cavill this was a very important piece of casting for me because martha kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as superman snyder said in the release we are thrilled to have diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination\\neditorinchief of the daily planet and the boss of lois lane fishburne is the first africanamerican to play perry white in a liveaction film fishburne remarked of his role my inspiration really is the late ed bradley who was a cbs correspondent on 60 minutes for many years  the legendary ed bradley  was a friend a mentor and a role model for me particularly because he worked in journalism and he was the kind of guy who walked with kings but he had the common touch and so he was my inspiration for perry\\ngeneral zods subcommander and a commander of the kryptonian military who is completely devoted and loyal to zod gal gadot was offered the role but declined because she was pregnant at that time this allowed her to be later cast as wonder woman in  about the role of faora traue said in an interview what i liked about her was that as a woman we have certain doubts and we think too much sometimes about ourselves and all these things theyre not there for faora shes a bred warrior so to really focus on that aspect that fear is a chemical reaction and that it was bred out of her and she doesnt have it its liberating when you actually think about it that youre just a onetrack mind theres no filter theres no double meaning she gets orders and she answers those orders without a question\\nkalels biological mother and loyal wife to jorel julia ormond had previously been announced as cast but

grant morrison mark waid geoff johns and brad meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot i told them its not that bad just treat superman returns as the ang lee hulk morrison said waid said the incredible hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise morrisons idea was similar to their work on allstar superman while waids was akin to  mark millar teaming with director matthew vaughn also planned an epic eighthour superman trilogy each installment released a year apart similar to the lord of the rings millar compared it to the godfather trilogy in which it would chronicle the entire life of superman from the early days of krypton where little kalel witnesses his fathers tireless struggle to save the planet to the finale where superman loses his powers as the sun starts to go supernova according to millar vaughn suggested his stardust actor charlie cox as a goldenage inspired superman when he was a bit more of a regular person\\nin august 2008 warner bros suggested a reboot of the film series studio executive jeff robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011 explaining that superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009 now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all paul levitz stated in an interview that batman holds the key to the superman reboot he elaborated everyone is waiting for nolan to sign on for another batman once that happens the release date for superman and all other future projects will follow in february 2009 mcg who previously planned to direct superman flyby expressed interest in returning to the superman franchise august 2009 saw a court ruling in which jerry siegels family recaptured 50 of the rights to supermans origins and siegels share of the copyright in action comics 1 in addition a judge ruled that warner bros did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films however if they did not begin production on a superman film by

during story discussions for the dark knight rises in 2008 david s goyer told christopher nolan his idea regarding how to present superman in a modern context impressed with goyers concept nolan pitched the idea to the studio who hired nolan to produce and goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of the dark knight nolan admired bryan singers work on superman returns for its connection to richard donners version stating that a lot of people have approached superman in a lot of different ways i only know the way that has worked for us thats what i know how to do emphasizing the idea that batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the man of steel would assure the integrity needed for the film nolan however clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series in which he commented each serves to the internal logic of the story they have nothing to do with each other\\nrobinov spoke to entertainment weekly and allowed a peek over the wall of secrecy surrounding their dc comics plans its setting the tone for what the movies are going to be like going forward in that its definitely a first step plans included for the film to contain references to the existence of other superheroes alluding to the possibility of a further dc universe and setting the tone for a shared fictional universe of dc comics characters on film guillermo del toro with whom goyer worked on blade ii turned down the directors position on the reboot because of his commitment on a film adaptation of at the mountains of madness while robert zemeckis was also approached ben affleck who would eventually be cast as bruce waynebatman in  darren aronofsky duncan jones jonathan liebesman matt reeves who would later direct a batman reboot and tony scott were considered as potential directors before zack snyder was hired in october 2010 casting began the following november snyder confirmed both booster gold

storyboard was created by filipinoamerican storyboard artist jay oliva in his first liveaction feature film project along with snyder oliva has cited the japanese anime shows dragon ball z and birdy the mighty as an inspiration for the films epic battle scenes during the films brainstorming oliva pitched the idea as i could come up with something ive never seen in liveaction american cinema and only in anime\\nfilming\\nprincipal photography began on august 1 2011 at an industrial park near dupage airport under the codename autumn frost zack snyder expressed reluctance to shooting the film in 3d due to the technical limitations of the format and instead chose to shoot the film twodimensionally and convert the film into 3d in post production for a 2d 3d and imax 3d release snyder also chose to shoot the film on film instead of digitally because he felt it would make the film a big movie experience cinematographer amir mokri shot the film with panavision panaflex millennium xl2 cameras and cseries anamorphic lenses filming was expected to last for two to three months production took place in plano illinois on august 22 to 29 according to an interview with michael shannon filming would continue until february 2012\\nman of steel filmed in the chicago area california and burnabys mammoth studios in vancouver which was utilized as a set for krypton and the extraterrestrial aircraft portrayed in the film vancouvers north shore waterfront area was also used for the oil rig rescue scene where superman is first introduced ucluelet and nanaimo british columbia feature prominently in the films first hourthe trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as alaska in the film filming took place in the chicago loop from september 7 to 17 the chicago shoot was a unit project meaning that filming would partake numerous establishing shots as well as cutaways and might not necessarily include principal cast members\\ndesign\\nman of steel features a redesigned superman costume by james acheson and michael wilkinson the costume preserves the color scheme and s logo but adopts darker tones and notably does not feature the red trunks usually worn by superman zack snyder said the costume is a modern aesthetic he and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film leading to their removal from the suit because of wilkinsons unavailability snyder chose acheson to design the suit however he only started developing it and wilkinson finished the development when he returned and designed the other characters costumes as well due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield the kryptonian armor for general zod was constructed through cgi to allow shannon freedom of movement in a march 2014 interview with esquire wilkinson explained the reason for the look of supermans redesigned suit\\neffects\\njohn dj desjardin served as the visual supervisor for man of steel with weta digital mpc and double negative providing the visual effects for the film zack snyder wanted the film to appear very natural because theres some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a documentarystyle film desjardin said we had to think about what that would mean since we also had to photograph some crazy action so for a lot of the previs we did wed start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was a lot of the rules are the battlestar galactica rules for the space cams that gary hurtzel developed for that miniseries where we want to make sure if were translating the camera at all it makes sense unless the action is so over the top like in the end where superman is beating up zodwe had to break it a bit\\nfor the first act of the film taking place on the planet krypton weta digital placed alienlike planet environments creatures and the principal means of displaya technology the filmmakers called liquid geometry weta digital visual effects supervisor dan lemmon explained that its a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like threedimensional pixels and they can create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is youre supposed to be seeing the beads of the display which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight bevel were designed to create a surface of the object to depict inside a consolelike figure\\nin the modeling and animation aspect of the liquid geometry goodwin explained we had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets so instead of going through the route of reducing the polygon count to something usable what we would then doyou would take the model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it and extract the matrix onto the animation and copy these points onto the matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that the model would after the animation artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a presimulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read sims were then run on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters in which goodwin further explained the bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the normal provided by the surface that was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation after the simulation process weta digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise lighting solutions directly worked on the set weta utilized renderman to take advantage of improved ray tracing and instancing objects\\nthe sequences where superman utilizes closecombat fight scenes with the other kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew desjardin explained when we do these fights and these hyperreal things we dont want to do the traditional ok im a cameraman im shooting a clean plate im going to pan over here to follow the action thats not really there yet but well put the action in later because thats us animating the characters to the camera so we would do that animation with the charactersgrappling punching or flying awayand we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and wed cut then wed put an environment camera there and take the environment and then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment so then we had a set of highres stills for the environment and the characters then in post we take the digidoubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment\\nmpc handled the visual effects for the smallville encounter sequence before providing the visual effects the shots were previsualized for the fight choreography after the previsualizations live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces if say superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away we would shoot our start position and end position and then bridge that gap with the cg takeovers says guillaume rocheron the mpc visual effects supervisor a camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor desjardin said its a sixstill camera rig thats built on a pipe rig so that you can run

building volumes for heights wed skin those volumes with kit parts but most of it then had to fall down so we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well\\nfor the destruction of the buildings the studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events the bullet physics software was a heavily impacted component for the utilization of the destruction wright said that we wanted to be able to run an rbd event and trigger all these secondary events whether it was glass or dust simulationsall of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way one of the advantages of this was that because it was all based around a limited number of input components you can make sure theyre modeled in a way theyre usable in

morrison who wrote the critically acclaimed miniseries allstar superman expressed mixed reaction to the film saying that while they kinda liked it and kinda didnt it did not present anything new as they would have preferred a second act type story with lex luthor instead of reestablishing the character by presenting information morrison is already familiar with morrison also questioned the need for a superhero to kill as did artist neal adams adams suggested that other alternatives were open to superman when zod threatened innocent people with his vision of heat such as covering his eyes he also criticized superman for not moving the battle away from metropolis as the character did at the end of superman ii jim lee had a positive opinion its epic its got a lot of heart but one of the things that was kind of missing from the last superman movie i think was the action and this movie has it in spades i mean it is a visual thrill ride it is amazing you get to see all the powers of

tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing directing and starring in a broadway adaptation of raymond carvers short story what we talk about when we talk about love however the birdman voice wants riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is an essential part of riggans identity\\njake riggans best friend and lawyer is producing the play which costars riggans girlfriend laura and broadway dbutante lesley riggans daughter sam a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect is working as his assistant the day before the first preview a light fixture falls onto riggans hapless costar ralph at lesleys suggestion riggan replaces ralph with her boyfriend the brilliant but volatile and selfabsorbed method actor mike shiner the first previews are disastrous mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water attempts to rape lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not look real riggan clashes continually with mike culminating in a brawl after riggan reads a new york times interview with mike in which he steals riggans personal reason for doing a raymond carver play jake persuades riggan to continue with the play when riggan berates sam after finding her using marijuana she insultingly rebukes and chastises him telling him he is irrelevant and the play is for his own vanity\\nduring the final preview riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door he is forced to walk through times square in his white briefs and enter through the audience to do the final scene a concerned sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show she thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting she shows him that the times square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him\\nriggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches tabitha dickinson a cynical and highly influential theater critic she promises to kill his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it on the way back riggan buys a pint of whiskey drinks it and passes out on a stoop the next day walking to the theater with a severe hangover he visualizes birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth birdman film riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of manhattan before arriving at the theater\\non opening night the play is going very well in his dressing room a strangely calm riggan confesses to his exwife sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair he also tells her about the birdman voice which she ignores after sylvia leaves riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide at the climax riggan shoots himself in the head on stage the play receives a standing ovation\\nriggan wakes up in a hospital  the suicide attempt merely blew off his nose which has been surgically reconstructed tabitha has published a glowing review of the play calling the suicide attempt just what american theater needed sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the twitter account she has created for him while she steps outside to find a vase riggan goes into the bathroom removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose and says goodbye to birdman seen seated on the toilet fascinated by the birds flying outside his room he opens the window peers up at them and then climbs out onto the ledge sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling\\nproduction\\ndevelopment\\nbirdman director alejandro g irritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre the original choice behind the films genre which was subsequently readapted to concentrate on riggans final emotional tail spin came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach all his previous films were dramas and after directing biutiful he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again the decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that we live our lives with no editing by presenting the film as a continuous shot he could submerge the protagonist in an inescapable reality and take the audience with him irritu shared his idea with the argentine screenwriterscousins nicols giacobone and armando bo as well as playwright alexander dinelaris jr who had all worked with him on his previous film their first reaction was to tell him the continuousshot idea could not work according to dinelaris and giacobone huge and important people told him to not even try the project for the same reason irritu himself described the technique as almost suicidal worrying that it would be distracting instead of immersive dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea they might have talked irritu out of it\\nthe personal and vocational experiences of the four cowriters were central to writing the script dinelaris exposure to broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage though he admitted exaggerating these he also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film were really more like play scenes irritus own experiences influenced many of birdmans themes what this film talks about i have been through irritu recalled i have seen and experienced all of it its what i have been living through the last years of my life dinelaris described this aspect as a laughing look at oneself but said it had to be done in a comedic way otherwise it would have been the most unbelievably selfabsorbed look at the subject themes from raymond carvers short story what we talk about when we talk about love which riggan adapts for stage in the story also influenced the script irritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in riggans story and those of carvers because of this it was important to the director that carvers story be the subject of the play depicted within the film therefore irritu stated that his desire to use carvers work was terrifying because the rights to using the carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film but no issues arose carvers widow writer tess gallagher loved the script and permitted the adaptation saying that carver would be laughing about the film\\nwhile some aspects of the film the first frame with riggan for instance went unchanged from birdmans conception to release others went through several iterations one of these was the sequence in which alter ego birdman takes complete control over riggans thoughts the writers knew it would occur at riggans lowest point so at one stage planned for it to happen after riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room in another discarded version riggan tries to drown himself in central park and flies out to save himself\\nthe films ending also changed the final version being written halfway through filming the original intended to depict johnny depp in riggans dressing room with a pirates of the caribbean poster in the back irritu grew to strongly dislike this ending calling it so embarrassing and rewrote it with dinelaris and giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream irritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by dinelaris he said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital and involved depp putting on riggan thomsons wig and in jack sparrows voice  the poster asks depp what the fuck are we doing here mate and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that the director and coauthors ruled out the satirical ending and favored the new more ambiguous ending\\nthe project of cowriting was expedited by the collaboration between the four cowriters on the internet working from different geographical locations with irritu in los angeles giacobone and bo in buenos aires and dinelaris in new york the script was mainly written through skype calls and emails although this complicated the writing process dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in birdman came from skype sessions at two in the morning where he and giacobone were cracking each other up incorporating the oneshot feature also affected the writing bo said we wrote everything thinking of this one shot and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting the oneshot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or reordered in postproduction so the writers needed to be very very sure about what was on the page as a result it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft as dinelaris summarized you have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot you have to be an idiot to attempt it it takes a great great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think youre going to do this birdman looks like a good idea now but at the time of production we did not know how we would land\\ncasting\\nirritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed among these was the lead role early in script development irritu did not have keaton in mind but he had changed his mind by the end when i finished the script i knew that michael was not the choice or option he was the guy irritu cast keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles he could handle the demands of the stage upclose work and comedy and empathy with a profound depth to both\\nkeaton knew about birdman before irritu contacted him he was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that irritu was making another film keaton a fan of his work flew home to find out more irritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner the first thing keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him regarding his role in tim burtons batman films but after irritu explained the role its technicalities and the films production keaton agreed to play riggan\\nirritu called his decision behind casting galifianakis as jake a bet galifianakis met the directors criteria of being lovable and funny but irritu also considered him sensitive which scored him the role emma stone already knew she wanted to work with irritu before she was offered the role of sam the script that irritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo man on wire which featured philippe petit crossing the twin towers on a tightrope irritu told the cast we are doing that\\nonce these actors were committed irritu sought funding he first invited fox searchlight pictures to finance the project but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high at one stage megan ellison of annapurna pictures wanted to be involved in the project but decided against it because unlike her other films she had not been involved since the beginning irritu approached brad weston president of new regency who accepted the offer when executive claudia lewis of searchlight heard about the deal she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal searchlight and new regency had previously worked together to finance 12 years a slave and they decided to join together for birdman financing a budget of 165 million\\nweston and lewis developed a close relationship with irritu editing the script with him and switching some of the actors when they joined production josh brolin was set to play the role of mike shiner but the financiers decided to switch him for norton because of scheduling conflicts\\nhe said nortons experience as a theatre actor combined with his selfconfidence meant that in a way there was some kind of mental reality to edward but norton believes he was the one who convinced irritu to take him on norton was a fan of the directors work and impressed with his ability to push outside filmmaking boundaries norton heard about irritus project from a friend once he got the script he read it straight through until 300 am norton said i laughed so hard i woke people up norton wanted to meet irritu the next day and once they met norton told him he could not cast someone who was the embodiment of what the script was taking aim at instead the director needed to cast someone who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience in this world irritu agreed\\namy ryan one of the last actors to be cast was invited because irritu had seen her in the play detroit lindsay duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script its delicious because of the writing but like shiners character irritu found casting laura difficult riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea and recalling the event said i told him that i would crawl across hot coals to work with him irritu described laura as a very wacky quirky role but said when andrea riseborough did it i knew that it was her because she did it right in the tone and she understood who she was  she was not judging\\nrehearsal and filming\\nonce the writing was finished irritu contacted friend and cinematographer emmanuel lubezki to discuss his idea for the film after reading the script lubezki was worried that irritu would offer him the job since birdman had all of the elements of a movie that i did not want to do at all comedy studio work and long takes but changed his mind after further discussion with the director the pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology to each his own cinema but not on any feature films lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision rodrigo prieto cinematographer of all four of irritus feature films was comfortable with but after receiving his blessing the two headed into preproduction\\nlubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way irritu envisioned meaning there would be no reference material to look up the two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves so they hired a warehouse in sony studios los angeles and built a proxy stage the setup was minimal canvas and cstands were used for walls while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas using a camera and some standins the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed they hired kaufman astoria studios in new york still irritu wanted to shoot at a broadway theater but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing st james theatre they then spent a few months designing and making blueprints of the shots and blocking the scenes using the standins to read and walk through the script the planning was precise irritu said there was no room to improvise at all every movement every line every door opening absolutely everything was rehearsed the actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed according to lubezki they did the scenes with the actors once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were he described the atypical approach like an upside down movie where you do postproduction before the production\\neditors douglas crise and stephen mirrione were involved in the project by this stage when irritu told mirrione that he planned for lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on the editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director such as the position of the nightday transitions and other moments of rest in the film production designer kevin thompson was on hand too and mapped out the scenes the camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way for example riggans makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew for instance designing the stairs a little wider for steadicam operator chris haarhoffs footsize\\nhe then constructed a template of the set they would build when in new york the writers were also involved in the rehearsals finetuning the script to make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\\nonce the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down the team headed to kaufman studios for more rehearsals followed by principal photography based exclusively in new york during the spring of 2013 the studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film including riggans dressing room and the theatre corridors st james theatre was used for two weeks it was the location for the stage scenes the bar segments were shot in the rum house on 47th street and 43rd street was used for the actionsequence the film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre throughout the locations including the studio the scenes were lit with natural light since lubezki wanted the movie to look as naturalistic as possible the nighttime scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of new york lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film not only did the lighting need to look realistic but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crews shadows onto the actors\\nthroughout shooting arri alexa cameras were used an alexa m was used for handheld sequences and an alexa xt was attached to the steadicam neither used matte boxes however steadicam operator chris haarhoff explained this decision we didnt want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline this way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actors face lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the alexa m because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors sometimes filming two inches 5 cm away from keatons face the camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before the cameras were lensed with leica summiluxc or zeiss master primes lubezki stated that these gave clean images saying you can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that in terms of sizes they initially trialled a 21mm but this did not give irritu the intimacy he wanted the crew instead went to an 18mm leica which was used for the majority of the film only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm but this was rare\\ndespite all the preparation a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals these usually lasted most of the morning after which photography followed the meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps emma stone in an interview with jimmy fallon recalled how a sixminute take of the scene where riggan first meets mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly takes were also repeated if a scenes rhythm did not feel right to irritu or if he and lubezki were not satisfied with a shots framing as shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped giving irritu more options during postproduction because of this the number of takes for a given scene was high usually 20 for the shorter scenes the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth chris haarhoff described it as a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment the locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too the live times square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists\\nwhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved but the cast had a positive experience norton said that normally in movie production half the people can check out due to repetitive aspects but during the shooting of birdman everybodys on the whole thing and youre all on pins and needles because youre all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball because of this stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast saying irritus process creates this sort of fury in you and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didnt even know you had naomi watts commented that the atmosphere felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my longtime memories from long ago andrea riseborough meanwhile described the process as wonderful mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then the magic happens with you and then everything leaves you and everythings silent once they successfully completed a take though it was obvious to everybody involved norton said ive never ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous authentic sort of cheer at having made it youre waiting for the scream from irritu and everybody was genuinely excited\\nmusic and soundtrack\\nthe films original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by antonio snchez the score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces including mahler and tchaikovsky irritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important nonetheless the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire mahler tchaikovsky rachmaninov ravel irritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play citing the radio in riggans room and the show itself as two sources of the music the classical music segments also included two compositions by american composer john adams several jazz compositions by victor hernndez stumpfhauser and joan valent counterbalance the original music composition by snchez the drum sections comprise the majority of the score however and were composed by snchez irritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes and that the drums for me was a great way to find the rhythm of the film in comedy rhythm is king and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space i knew i needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film\\nirritu contacted friend and jazz drummer antonio snchez in january 2013 inviting him to compose the score for the film his reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to lubezkis thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot it was a scary proposition because i had no point of reference of how to achieve this theres no other movie i know that has a score like this snchez had also not worked on a film before nevertheless after receiving the script he composed rhythmic themes for each of the characters irritu was looking for the opposite approach however preferring spontaneity and improvisation snchez then waited until production moved to new york before composing more where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film following this a week before principal photography he and irritu went to a studio to record some demos during these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene then while snchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds they recorded around seventy demos which irritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set and once filming was complete spliced them into the rough cut snchez summarized the process by saying the movie fed on the drums and the drums fed on the imagery the official soundtrack was released as a cd 77 min in october 2014 and as an lp 69 min in april 2015\\nwhen the academy of motion picture arts and sciences released their longlist for the academy award for best original score in december 2014 birdman was absent from the list the previous day snchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision quoting rule fifteen of the 87th academy award rules noting the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of nonoriginal mostly classical music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission snchez launched an appeal and along with irritu and the executive vicepresident of fox music they sent letters to charles fox the chair of the academys music branch executive committee asking that the committee reconsider their decision one of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music which after being clarified snchez thought he was on really solid ground a response from fox on december 19 however explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held and although its members had great respect for the score and considered it superb they thought that the classical music was also used as scoring equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music ultimately they did not overturn their decision snchez said that he and irritu were not satisfied with the explanation\\npostproduction and visual effects\\nbirdman was edited by douglas crise and stephen mirrione who had both worked with the director before on 21 grams and babel stitching shots together was of course a crucial component of the editing but crise and mirrione already had experience doing this the director had included takes that were joined together in previous films but in these if the editors didnt think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts mirrione said that in birdman irritu had let go of that safety net because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on and during principal photography crise was on set every day mirrione was busy and unable to be in new york crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback but said he was happy irritu dragged it out of him knowing that they wouldnt have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right for stitching aside from the director crise also discussed strategies with lubezki and thompson and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors bodies the editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts so without this tool used snchezs music instead the director gave the new york recordings to crise early on to help with pacing asking him to cut the music to the film still in terms of the editing workflow crise described it as pretty traditional the editors cut the film together back in los angeles a few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself and transitioned into visualeffects mode where they finetuned the shots\\nthe visual effects for the film were created by montreal based studio rodeo fx they spent four months working on the film and according to visual effects supervisor ara khanikian visual effects touched 90 of the frames in the movie a lot of the work was subtle for example stitching shots together or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene many shots in the film feature mirrors and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these to accomplish this the studio created a 25d digital matte painting of the reflected environment they then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections and replaced these with the digital environment some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film a mattepainting was constructed for the nightday time lapses in the film too created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features captured at different times of the day together rodeo fx also adjusted the pace of scenes irritu demanded a very precise rhythm and flow to the film so the studio had to respeed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired\\nunlike some of the smaller adjustments though the flying sequence required extensive preparation irritu spent three weeks with halon entertainment to previsualize the sequence in new york lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence using a camera crane on a truck when these were shot lubezki had mounted four gopro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him later on a greenstage in montreal using a technique he had developed on gravity lubezki lit keaton with led panels featuring highdynamicrange images of the surrounding new york footage the panels then realistically lit keaton khanikian described the effect of the process saying instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen we were getting the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on michaels head it worked so well rodeo fx then completed the final shots the sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished they had only imagined what it was going to feel like but once it was completed it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\\nsound design for the film was handled by martn hernndez who has worked on all the directors feature films the production sound his team was given was surprisingly perfect and clean so they didnt need to spend much time tidying it the lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way hernndez edited sound though normally alejandro likes as he calls it the clashing of the sounds the camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds texture dialog obviously that would not work on birdman because here everything is flowing additionally the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen a nontrivial task since the camera was nearly always moving hernndez also helped to cut snchezs tracks selecting and editing moments from the new york recordings against the film when the tracks were rerecording in los angeles in order to have distance and closeness and resonance the team used thirty two microphones for each take hernndez described the job as crazy a large challenge of the postproduction soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience particularly in the scene when mike is drunk and comes out of character irritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers hernndez said he thought for a film in general that the narrative created by sound provokes more explosions than that created by images and that in birdman alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\\nthe digital intermediate was completed by a team at technicolor led by steven scott they had previously collaborated with lubezki on gravity but needed to approach birdman differently because of the continuousshot approach according to scott we have never done anything like it before the color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between colorcorrected environments were invisible in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts to do this the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary and in the middle of pans and other camera movements they then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve allowing them to do all these independent crazy complicated color corrections that would flow organically from one to another inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software scott and his team were using did not have but an enterprise agreement between technicolor and the softwares developer led to the creation of a tool scott required for the color timing itself one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible this required amongst other things that faces be highlighted but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked then the team would carry out the animations of the whole process irritu remarked that everyone was out of their comfort zone while scott said it was the most challenging di project of his career\\nanalysis and themes\\nthe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film at the ending of the film it can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included among other subjects a film genre b intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot and c the complex interaction of riggans personal life with his professional life as an actor a short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a blackhumor film a mental health film a realismsurrealismmagical realism film a darkhumor parody film a film of psychological realism a failed domestic reconciliation drama or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism irritu has maintained his penchant wellknown to followers of his previous films for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late midlife crisis in the life of a hasbeen actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life\\nthe fatherdaughter themes in the film portrayed through the relationship of riggan and samantha were the most difficult and important parts of the film to depict for cowriters dinelaris and giacobone as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters when the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director refused to comment upon they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out the writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon riggan or the character of birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film in particular the portrayal of riggans daughter samantha\\nnoting the thematic pull between riggans insanity or actual superpowers travis lacouter of first things writes that the importance of these powers real or imagined is apparent they are for riggan the thing beyond the labels the kernel of his genius and because he sees drawing upon them as selling out the source of his great angst lacouter concludes that the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore repress or resent\\ncritics barbara schweizerhof and matthew pejkovici see the films central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism with pejkovici laudably comparing it to fellinis film 8 1963 as pejkovici states much like fellinis 1960sic classic 8 irritus birdman is a very intimate film about an artists malaise yet is epic innovative and ambitious in approach irritu captures the artists battle between ambition admiration and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a onetake format as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors across the stage out on the busy nyc streets and back again in breathtaking fashion\\nthematically richard brody also compared it to opening night 1977 by john cassavetes brody said that the actors played in the sort of modern naturalism without eccentricity of gesture excess of expression or heightened and formalistic precision that is the businesscasual of contemporary cinema the wall street journals caryn james compared the story to that of don quixote who believes himself to be a knight as the main character believes he is a superhero the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century this relationship was also highlighted by the scholarly literature\\nrelease\\nbirdman was selected as the opening film of the 71st venice international film festival along with

websites critical consensus reads a thrilling leap forward for director alejandro gonzlez irritu birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from michael keaton and edward norton on metacritic the film received a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 58 critics indicating universal acclaim audiences surveyed by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of a on an a to f scale in 2015 the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by the guardian\\nmargaret pomeranz and david stratton from at the movies praised the films writing direction performances and cinematography stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as really exciting while pomeranz summarised its just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made the pair both gave the film five stars making birdman the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014 in the new york times manohla dargis compared the main character to icarus the greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun she also noted a reference to susan sontags against interpretation in the dressingroom mirror\\nrichard kolker compared the film to both alfred hitchcocks rope 1948 and alexander sokurovs russian ark 2002 kolker concludes that birdman is a film about acting identity transformation and the mysterious effects of superheroes and is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take as with rope the edits are hidden and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self a search doomed from the start ollie cochran called the film an amalgam of technical prowess hypnotising visuals and pragmatically perceptive dialogue believing it to be a thoughtprovoking energetic perspective of a fading actor looking to revitalise his career\\ninternational reception of the film was also at a high level of praise in germany a film aggregate rating at epd film gave the film a 34 out of 5 rating based on seven critiques the german critic barbara schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars complimenting the directors satirical virtuosity in making the film in her review schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to rewatch it a second and third time and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting the feverish stream of consciousness of its main character throughout the film\\nthe camerawork which depicts most of the film as one continuous take was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage the acting was widely praised particularly keatons with peter debruge of variety calling the performance the comeback of the century debruge described the film as a selfaware showbiz satire and called it a triumph on every creative level robbie collin of the daily telegraph rated the film 55 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by emmanuel lubezki director of photography richard roeper gave the film an a and wrote that keaton made a serious case for an academy award for best actor nomination which keaton later achieved\\nwriting for the new yorker richard brody called the film godardian comparing it to pierrot le fou 1965 every man for himself 1980 alphaville 1965 and germany year 90 nine zero 1991 four classic films by french director jeanluc godard however he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery adding its not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with mr godard in his critical comments on the film he concluded that the film traded on facile casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce and delivered a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama in another review in the new yorker separately supplementing the review by brody anthony lane rejected the films suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films explaining someone could have told irritu that critics though often mean are not preemptively so and that anybody whod say as tabitha does im going to destroy your play before actually seeing it would not stay long in the job\\nsome reviews were negative richard lawson of vanity fair called the film hoary and deceptively simple scott tobias writing for the dissolve gave the film 15 stars he commends lubezkis cinematography as succeeding at trapping viewers in a pressurecooker atmosphere as riggan and his players struggle to keep it together but suggests that irritu is incapable of modulation and that there exists a sourness to birdman that irritu cant turn into wit\\naccolades\\nat the 87th academy awards birdman won four academy awards best picture best director best original screenplay and

exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor\\nas his work gained recognition balzac began corresponding with a polish baroness named ewelina haska who first contacted him through an anonymous 1832 letter signed ltrangre the stranger they developed an affectionate friendship in letters and when she became a widow in 1841 balzac sought her hand in marriage he visited her often in poland and germany but various complications prohibited their union one of these was an affair balzac had with his housekeeper louise breugniot as she became aware of his affection for mme hanska breugniot stole a collection of their letters and used them to extort money from balzac even after this episode however he grew closer to mme hanska with each visit and by 1846 he had begun preparing a home to share with her he grew hopeful that they could marry when she became pregnant but she fell ill in december and suffered a miscarriage\\nthe mid19th century was a time of profound transformation in french government and society the reign of king charles\\xa0x ended in 1830 when a wave of agitation and dissent forced him to abdicate he was replaced by louisphilippe who named himself king of the french rather than the standard king of france\\xa0 an indication that he answered more to the nascent bourgeoisie than the aristocratic ancien rgime the change in government took place while the economy in france was moving from mercantilism to industrial development this opened new opportunities for individuals hoping to acquire wealth and led to significant changes in social norms members of the aristocracy for example were forced to relate socially to the nouveau riche usually with tense results the democratic spirit of the french revolution also affected social interactions with a shift in popular allegiance away from the church and the monarchy\\nin the mid19th century a new style of the novel became popular in france the serial format known as the romanfeuilleton presented stories in short regular installments often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters although balzacs la vieille fille the old maid 1836 was the first such work published in france the romanfeuilleton gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends eugne sue and alexandre dumas pre balzac disliked their serial writing however especially sues socialist depiction of lowerclass suffering balzac wanted to dethrone what he called les faux dieux de cette littrature btarde the false gods of this bastard literature he also wanted to show the world that despite his poor health and tumultuous career he was plus jeune plus frais et plus grand que jamais younger fresher and greater than ever his first efforts to render a quality feuilleton were unsuccessful even though splendeurs et misres des courtisanes a harlot high and low published in segments from 1838 to 1847 was celebrated by critics balzac complained to mme hanska that he was doing pure sue he tried again in 1844 with modeste mignon but public reactions were mixed two years later balzac began a new project determined to create something from his own old pen again\\nwriting and publication\\nafter resting for a week in june 1846 at the chteau de sach in tours balzac returned to paris and began working on a short story called le parasite which he eventually developed into the novel le cousin pons he intended from the start to pair it with another novel collecting them under the title les parents pauvres the poor relations he based the second book on a story his sister laure surville had written called la cousine rosalie and published in 1844 in le journal des enfants writing intensively he produced the entire novel named la cousine bette after the main character in two months this was a significant accomplishment owing to his bad health but its length made balzacs writing speed especially remarkable one critic calls the writing of les parents pauvres balzacs last explosion of creative energy another suggests that this effort was almost the last straw which broke down balzacs gigantic strength\\nbalzacs usual mode of revision involved vast complicated edits made to galley proofs he received from the printer when creating la cousine bette however he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece without viewing a single proof the book was serialized in le constitutionnel from 8\\xa0october to 3\\xa0december and balzac rushed to keep up with the newspapers rapid printing schedule he produced an average of eight pages each day but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved balzac was paid 12836 francs for the series which was later published with le cousin pons as a twelvevolume book by chiendowski and ption the first collected edition of la cousine bette was organized into 132 chapters but these divisions were removed when balzac added it to his massive collection la comdie humaine in 1848\\nplot summary\\nthe first third of the novel provides a lengthy exploration of the characters histories balzac makes this clear after 150 pages ici se termine en quelque sorte lintroduction de cette histoire here ends what is in a way the introduction to this story at the start of the novel adeline hulot  wife of the successful baron hector hulot  is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named clestin crevel his desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous baron hulot had won the attentions of the singer jospha mirah also favored by crevel mme hulot rejects crevels advances the baron has so completely lavished money on jospha that he has borrowed heavily from his uncle johann  and unable to repay the money the baron instead arranges a war department post in algeria for johann with instructions that johann will be in a situation in that job to embezzle the borrowed money the hulots daughter hortense has begun searching for a husband their son victorin is married to crevels daughter celestine\\nmme hulots cousin bette also called lisbeth harbors a deep but hidden resentment of her relatives success especially of hortense stealing bettes intended sweetheart a peasant woman with none of the physical beauty of her cousin bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middleclass suitors who were clearly motivated by her connection to the hulots and remains unmarried at the age of 42 one day she comes upon a young unsuccessful polish sculptor named wenceslas steinbock attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own as she nourishes him back to health she develops a maternal and romantic fondness for him at the beginning of the story bette is living in a modest apartment in a lodging house shared by the marneffe couple both of whom are ambitious and amoral bette befriends valrie the young and very attractive wife of a war department clerk fortin marneffe the two women form a bond to attain their separate goals  for valrie the acquisition of money and valuables for bette the ruination of the hulot household by means of valries luring both the baron and steinbock into infidelity and financial ruin\\nbaron hulot meanwhile is rejected by jospha who explains bluntly that she has chosen another man because of his larger fortune hulots despair is quickly alleviated when he visits bette in her lodging and there meets and falls in love with valrie marneffe he showers her with gifts and soon establishes a luxurious house for her and m marneffe with whom he works at the war department bette joins them in their new home to serve as an excuse for the barons visits these debts compounded by the money he borrowed to lavish on jospha threaten the hulot familys financial security panicked he convinces his uncle johann fischer to quietly embezzle funds from a war department outpost in algiers hulots woes are momentarily abated and bettes happiness is shattered when\\xa0 at the end of the introduction\\xa0 hortense hulot marries wenceslas steinbock\\ncrushed at having lost steinbocks as her intended spouse bette swears vengeance on the hulot family her strategy is to work on baron hulots demonstrated weakness for acquiring and lavishing more money than he has on young mistresses soon the baron is completely besotted  and financially overextended  with valrie and completely compromised by repeatedly promoting her husband within the barons section of the war department before long bette has already contrived to have crevel and steinbock also ensnared by valries charms hortense discovers steinbocks infidelity and returns to her mothers home before long the barons misconduct becomes known to the war department uncle johann is arrested in algeria and commits suicide the baron is forced to retire suddenly his brother a famous war hero saves him from prison and then quickly dies of shame over the family disgrace the baron deserts his family and hides from his creditors it appears that valrie soon a widow will marry crevel and thus gain entrance to the hulot family as celestines motherinlaw in short the family is devastated by these repeated blows  and bettes machinations are completely concealed from them\\ncharacters and inspirations\\nbalzac had written more than seventy novels when he began la cousine bette and populated them with recurring characters many of the characters in the novel therefore appear with extensive backstories and biographical depth for example clestin crevel first appeared in balzacs 1837 novel csar birotteau working for the title character having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book crevel spends his time in la cousine bette enjoying the spoils of his labor another important recurring character is marshal hulot who first appeared as a colonel in les chouans in the years between that story and la cousine bette he became the count of forzheim in a letter to the constitutionnel balzac described how marshal hulot gained this title the presence of crevel and marshal hulot\\xa0 among others\\xa0 in la cousine bette allows a continuation of each characters life story adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events\\nother recurring characters appear only briefly in la cousine bette previous appearances however give deep significance to the characters presence this is the case with vautrin the criminal mastermind who tutors young eugene de rastignac in balzacs 1835 novel le pre goriot when he resurfaces in la cousine bette he has joined the police and introduces the hulot family to his aunt mme nourrison who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes although vautrins presence in la cousine bette is brief his earlier adventures in le pre goriot provide instant recognition and emotional texture elsewhere balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society for example several scenes feature artists like jeanjacques bixiou who first appeared in 1837s les employs and in many other books thereafter the world of parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with the inclusion of several characters from les comdiens sans le savoir 1846 and bianchon appears\\xa0 as always\\xa0 when a doctor is needed\\nbalzacs use of recurring characters has been identified as a unique component of his fiction it enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue when the characters reappear notes the critic samuel rogers they do not step out of nowhere they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which for an interval we have not been allowed to see some readers however are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories and feel deprived of important context for the characters detective novelist arthur conan doyle said that he never tried to read balzac because he did not know where to begin the characterization in la cousine bette is considered especially skillful anthony pugh in his book balzacs recurring characters says that the technique is employed for the most part without that feeling of selfindulgence that mars some of balzacs later work almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation biographer noel gerson calls the characters in la cousine bette among the most memorable balzac ever sketched\\nbette fischer\\ndescriptions of bette are often connected to savagery and animal imagery her name for example is a homophone in french for bte beast one passage explains that elle ressemblait aux singes habills en femmes she sometimes looked like one of those monkeys in petticoats elsewhere her voice is described as having une jalousie de tigre tigerlike jealousy her beastly rage comes to the surface with ferocity when she learns of steinbocks engagement to hortense\\nwhen she learns that her cousin adeline has been welcoming steinbock into the hulot home bette swears revenge adeline se dit lisbeth  adeline tu me le payeras je te rendrai plus laide que moi adeline muttered lisbeth oh adeline you shall pay for this i will make you uglier than i am her cruelty and lust for revenge lead critics to call her demonic and one of balzacs most terrifying creations because of her willingness to manipulate the people around her bette has been compared to iago in william shakespeares play othello her fierce persona is attributed partly to her peasant background and partly to her virginity which provides according to balzac une force diabolique ou la magie noire de la volont diabolical strength or the black magic of the will\\nin a letter to mme hanska balzac indicated that he based the character of bette on three women from his life his mother mme hanskas aunt rosalie rzewuska and the poet marceline desbordesvalmore balzac had a tumultuous relationship with his mother for most of his life and he incorporated some of her personality particularly her obstinate persistence in living as one critic calls it into bette rosalie rzewuska disapproved of mme hanskas relationship with balzac biographers agree that her cold determination was part of the authors recipe for bette elements taken from marceline desbordesvalmore are more complex she faced many setbacks in life and she and balzac became friends after she left the theatre to take up poetry\\nvalrie marneffe\\nbettes coconspirator in the destruction of the hulot family is beautiful and greedy valrie marneffe the unsatisfied wife of a war department clerk they develop a deep friendship which many critics consider an example of lesbian affection because of their relationship and similar goals the critic frederic jameson says that valrie serves as a kind of emanation of bette\\nvalrie is repulsed by her ugly husband and has gone five years without kissing him she explains bluntly that her position as a married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price after marneffe dies valrie jockeys for position between hulot and monts while also sleeping with steinbock then discards them all to marry crevel who offers the most wealth she amuses herself by mocking her lovers devotion and this wickedness\\xa0 not to mention her gruesome demise\\xa0 has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of balzacs morality tale\\nin one important scene valrie models for steinbock as delilah standing victorious over the ruined samson with obvious parallels to her own activities she describes her vision for the piece il sagit dexprimer la puissance de la femme samson nest rien l cest le cadavre de la force dalila cest la passion qui ruine tout what you have to show is the power of woman samson is a secondary consideration he is the corpse of dead strength it is delilahpassionthat ruins everything\\nalthough balzac did not draw specifically from the women in his life to create valrie parallels have been observed in some areas the tumultuous end of his affair with louise breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to mme hanska is similar in some ways to valries manipulation of steinbock critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by balzac during mme hanskas pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by baron hulot when valrie conceives and loses her child although he never ascribed to mme hanska any of the traits in valries treacherous character he felt a devotion similar to that of hulot he once wrote to her je fais pour mon eve toute les folies quun hulot fait pour une marneffe je te donnerai mon sang mon honneur ma vie i commit for you all the follies that a hulot commits for madame marneffe i give you my blood my honor my life\\nhector and adeline hulot\\nbaron hector hulot is a living manifestation of male sexual desire unrestrained and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family as the novel progresses he becomes consumed by his libido even in a physical sense when valrie tells him to stop dyeing his hair he does so to please her his financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home by the end of the book he is an elderly decrepit shell of a man baron hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife\\xa0 without irony\\xa0 if he can bring home his fifteenyearold mistress\\nadeline hulot on the other hand is mercy personified like her cousin bette she comes from a peasant background but has internalized the ideals of 19thcentury womanhood including devotion grace and deference she reveals in the first scene that she has known for years about her husbands infidelities but refuses to condemn him adelines forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw some suggest that she is partly to blame for hulots wandering affection ca prendergast for example calls her forgiveness an inadequate and even positively disastrous response to her situation he further suggests that adeline by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife has excised from herself the erotic power to which the baron is drawn one could at the very least offer the tentative speculation that hulots obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in adeline that the terrible logic of hulots excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife others are less accusatory adelines nearly infinite mercy they say is evidence of foolishness critic herbert j hunt declares that she shows more imbecility than christian patience and david bellos points out that like her husband she is driven by passion\\xa0 albeit of a different kind adelines desire for good for the family for hector for god is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire\\xa0\\nbalzacs inspiration for the characters of hector and adeline remain unclear but several critics have been eager to speculate three officers named hulot were recognized for their valor in the napoleonic wars and some suggest that balzac borrowed the name of comte hector daure none of these men however were known for the sort of philandering or thievery exhibited by baron hulot in the novel instead balzac may have used himself as the model his many affairs with women across the social spectrum lead some to suggest that the author found much of hulot in himself balzacs friend victor hugo meanwhile was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in july 1845 the similarity of his name to hector hulot and that of his wifes maiden name adle foucher to adeline fischer has been posited as a possible indication of the characters origins\\nwenceslas steinbock\\nthe polish sculptor wenceslas steinbock is important primarily because of bettes attachment to him he offers bette a source of pride a way for her to prove herself worthy of her familys respect when hortense marries steinbock bette feels as though she has been robbed prendergast insists that the incident must literally be described as an act of theft\\nsteinbocks relevance also lies in his background and profession illustrating balzacs conception of the polish people as well as himself having spent more than a decade befriending mme hanska and visiting her family in poland balzac believed he had insight into the national character as he felt about most groups he observed thus descriptions of steinbock are often laced with commentary about the polish people soyez mon amie ditil avec une de ces dmonstrations caressantes si familires aux polonais et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilit be my sweetheart he added with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the poles for which they are unjustly accused of servility\\ncritics also consider steinbock important because of his artistic genius like louis lambert and lucien chardon in illusions perdues he is a brilliant man\\xa0 just as balzac considered himself to be before he is nurtured and directed by bette however steinbocks genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide later when he leaves bettes circle of influence he fails again thus he demonstrates balzacs conviction that genius alone is useless without determination bellos organizes steinbock and bette into a duality of weakness and strength whereas the polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying the lust to which steinbock falls prey steinbocks drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art which gives him an inflated sense of accomplishment one critic refers to the artists downfall as vanity\\xa0 spoiled by premature renown\\nstyle\\nif balzacs goal was as he claimed to write a realist novel from his own old pen rather than mimic the style of eugne sue history and literary criticism have declared him successful william stowe calls la cousine bette a masterpiece of classical realism and bellos refers to it as one of the great achievements of nineteenthcentury realism comparing it to war and peace some sections of the book are criticized for being melodramatic and balzac biographer v s pritchett even refers to a representative excerpt as bad writing most critics however consider the moralistic elements of the novel deceptively complex and some point out that the romanfeuilleton format required a certain level of titillation to keep readers engaged others indicate that balzacs interest in the theatre was an important reason for the inclusion of melodramatic elements\\nbalzacs trademark realism begins on the first page of the novel wherein crevel is described wearing a national guard uniform complete with the lgion dhonneur details from the 1830s also appear in the novels geographic locations the hulot family home for example is found in the aristocratic area of paris known as the faubourg saintgermain bettes residence is on the opposite end of the social spectrum in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the louvre les tnbres le silence lair glacial la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent  faire de ces maisons des espces de cryptes des tombeaux vivants darkness silence an icy chill and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt tombs of the living descriptions of her meager quarters are\\xa0 as usual in balzacs work\\xa0 an acute reflection of her personality the same is true of the marneffe home at the outset it contains les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe the illusory appearance of sham luxury from the shabby chairs in the drawingroom to the dustcoated bedroom\\nprecise detail is not spared in descriptions of decay and disease two vivid elements in the novel marneffe for example represents crapulence his decrepit body is a symbol of societys weakness at the time worn away from years of indulgence the poison which kills valrie and crevel is also described in ghastly detail the doctor bianchon explains ses dents et ses cheveux tombent elle a laspect des lpreux elle se fait horreur  ellemme ses mains pouvantables  voir sont enfles et couvertes de pustules verdtres les ongles dchausss restent dans les plaies quelle gratte enfin toutes les extrmits se dtruisent dans la sanie qui les ronge she is losing her hair and teeth her skin is like a lepers she is a horror to herself her hands are horrible covered with greenish pustules her nails are loose and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors\\nla cousine bette is unapologetic in its bleak outlook and makes blunt connections between characters origins and behavior for these reasons it is considered a key antecedent to naturalist literature novelist mile zola called it an important roman exprimental experimental novel and praised its acute exploration of the characters motivations some critics note that la cousine bette showed an evolution in balzacs style\\xa0 one which he had little time to develop pointing to the nuance of plot and comprehensive narration style stowe suggests that the novel might in happier circumstances have marked the beginning of a new mature late balzac\\nthemes\\npassion vice and virtue\\nvalries line about delilah being la passion qui ruine tout passion which ruins everything is symbolic coming as it does from a woman whose passion accelerates the ruin of most people around her\\xa0 including herself baron hulot meanwhile is desire incarnate his wandering libido bypasses concern for his wife brother children finances and even his own health bette is living vengeance and adeline desperately yearns for the happy home she imagined in the early years of marriage each character is driven by a fiery passion which in most cases consumes the individual as balzac puts it la passion est un martyre passion is martyrdom\\nthe intensity of passion and the consequences of its manifestation result in a stark contrast of vice and virtue bette and valrie are pure wickedness and even celebrate the ruin of their targets as one critic says lifes truths are viewed in their most atrocious form mocking the use of the guillotine during the french revolution while acknowledging her own malicious intent valrie says with regard to delilah la vertu coupe la tte le vice ne vous coupe que les cheveux virtue cuts off your head vice only cuts off your hair hulot is not intentionally cruel but his actions are no less devastating to the people around him\\non the other side of the moral divide adeline and her children stand as shining examples of virtue and nobility\\xa0 or so it would seem hortense ridicules her aunt when bette mentions her protg wenceslas steinbock providing a psychological catalyst for the ensuing conflict victorin repeatedly expresses outrage at his fathers philandering yet crosses a significant moral boundary when he agrees to fund mme nourrisons plan to eradicate valrie as one critic puts it victorins decision marks a point in the novel where the scheme of right versus wrong immediately dissolves into a purely amoral conflict of different interests and passions regulated less by a transcendent moral law than by the relative capacity of the different parties for cunning and ruthlessness the cruelties of the hulot children are brief but significant owing as much to their obliviousness intentional in the case of victorin who asks not to learn the details of mme nourrisons scheme as to malicious forethought\\nthe question of adelines virtue is similarly complicated although she is forgiving to the point of absurdity she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr some have compared her to balzacs title character in le pre goriot who sacrifices himself for his daughters as bellos puts it adelines complicity with hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character but it undermines her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel this complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to crevel who has since lost interest in order to repay her husbands debts her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than valries overt extortion since adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of baron hulots infidelity for the remainder of the novel adeline trembles uncontrollably a sign of her weakness later when she visits the singer jospha on whom her husband once doted adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction she wonders aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures hulot seeks outside of their home\\nultimately both vice and virtue fail valrie is devoured by monts poison a consequence of her blithe attitude toward his emotion bette is unsuccessful in her effort to crush her cousins family and dies as one critic puts it in the margins adelines catholic mercy on the other hand fails to redeem her husband and her children are similarly powerless\\xa0 as victorin finally admits on the novels last page like raphael de valentin in balzacs 1831 novel la peau de chagrin hulot is left with nothing but vouloir desire a force which is both essential for human existence and eventually apocalyptic\\ngender and homoeroticism\\ngender roles especially the figure of the ideal woman are central to la cousine bette the four leading female characters bette valrie adeline and hortense embody stereotypically feminine traits each pair of women revolves around a man and they compete for his attention valrie and adeline for baron hulot bette and hortense for wenceslas steinbock balzacs study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of hulot and the weakwilled inconstancy of steinbock with the occasional appearance of victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his fathers absence\\ncritics pay special attention to bettes lack of traditional femininity and her unconventional relationships with two characters she is described from the outset as having des qualits dhomme certain manly qualities with similar descriptions elsewhere her relationship and attitude toward steinbock moreover hint at her masculinity she commands him into submission and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture her domination is tempered by maternal compassion but the couples relationship is compared to an abusive marriage il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les mauvais traitements dune semaine  cause des caresses dun fugitif raccommodement he was like a woman who forgives a week of illusage for the sake of a kiss and a brief reconciliation\\nbettes relationship with valrie is layered with overtones of lesbianism early in the book bette is capte bewitched by valrie and quickly declares to her je vous aime je vous estime je suis  vous i love you i esteem you i am wholly yours this affection may have been platonic but neighbors of the marneffes\\xa0 along with many readers\\xa0 suspect that their bond transcends friendship as with steinbock bette and valrie assume butch and femme roles the narration even mentions le contraste de la mle et sche nature de la lorraine avec la jolie nature crole de valrie the contrast between lisbeths dry masculine nature and valeries creole prettiness the homoeroticism evolves through the novel as bette feeds on valries power to seduce and control the hulot men as one critic says valries body becomes at least symbolically the locus of bettes only erotic pleasure\\nwealth and society\\nas with many of his novels balzac analyzes the influence of history and social status in la cousine bette the book takes places between 1838 and 1846 when the reign of louisphilippe reflected and directed significant changes in the social structure balzac was a legitimist favoring the house of bourbon and idolized napoleon bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power balzac felt that french society under the house of orlans lacked strong leadership and was fragmented by the demands of parliament he also believed that catholicism provided guidance for the nation and that its absence heralded moral decay\\nbalzac demonstrated these beliefs through the characters lives in la cousine bette the conflict between baron hulot and the perfumer crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the ancien rgime and the newly developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs although he despised the socialist politics of eugne sue balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from lifes important virtues the characters\\xa0 especially bette valrie and crevel\\xa0 are fixated on their need for money and do whatever they must to obtain it as crevel explains to adeline vous vous abusez cher ange si vous croyez que cest le roi louisphilippe qui rgne\\xa0 audessus de la charte il y a la sainte la vnre la solide laimable la gracieuse la belle la noble la jeune la toutepuissante pice de cent sous you are quite mistaken my angel if you suppose that king louisphilippe rules us\\xa0 supreme above the charter reigns the holy venerated substantial delightful obliging beautiful noble everyouthful and allpowerful fivefranc piece\\nthemes of corruption and salvation are brought to the fore as valrie and crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison when his daughter urges him to meet with a priest crevel angrily refuses mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation la mort regarde  deux fois avant de frapper un maire de paris death thinks twice of it before carrying off a mayor of paris valrie meanwhile makes a deathbed conversion and urges bette to abandon her quest for revenge ever the courtesan valrie describes her new christianity in terms of seduction je ne puis maintenant plaire qu dieu je vais tcher de me rconcilier avec lui ce sera ma dernire coquetterie i can please no one now but god i will try to be reconciled to him and that will be my last flirtation\\xa0\\nreception and adaptations\\nthe critical reaction to la cousine bette was immediate and positive which balzac did not expect whether due to the intensity of its creation or the tumult of his personal life the author was surprised by the praise he received he wrote i did not realize how good la cousine bette is\\xa0 there is an immense reaction in my favour i have won the collected edition sold consistently well and was reprinted nineteen times before the turn of the 20th century 20thcentury critics remain enthusiastic in their praise for the novel saintsbury insists it is beyond all question one of the very greatest of balzacs works biographer graham robb calls la cousine bette the masterpiece of his premature old age\\nsome 19thcentury critics attacked the book on the grounds that it normalized vice and corrupt living chief among these were disciples of the utopian theorist charles fourier they disapproved of the immorality inherent in the novels bleak resolution critics like alfred nettement and eugne marron declared that balzacs sympathy lay with baron hulot and valrie marneffe they lambasted him for not commenting more on the characters degenerate behavior\\xa0 the same stylistic choice later celebrated by naturalist writers mile zola and hippolyte taine\\nbalzacs novel has been adapted several times for the screen the first was in 1928 when french filmmaker max derieux directed alice tissot in the title role margaret tyzack played the role of bette in the five part serial cousin bette made in 1971 by the bbc which also starred helen mirren as valrie marneffe the film cousin bette was released in 1998 directed by des mcanuff jessica lange starred in the title role joined by bob hoskins as crevel and elisabeth shue as the singer jenny cadine screenwriters lynn siefert and susan tarr changed the story significantly and eliminated valrie the 1998 film was panned by critics for its generally poor acting and awkward dialogue stephen holden of the new york times commented that the movie treats the novel as a thoroughly modern social comedy peopled with raging narcissists opportunists and flatout fools the 1998 film changed the novel quite drastically retaining the basic idea of bette avenging herself on her enemies and not only eliminating valerie but letting bette survive at the end\\nla cousine bette was adapted for the stage by jeffrey hatcher best known for his screenplay stage beauty based on his stage play compleat female stage beauty the antaeus company in north hollywood produced a workshop in 2008 and presented the world premiere of cousin bette in early 2010 in north hollywood california the adaptation

into an uncharted region of the african interior they are captured by the savage amahagger people the adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen who is worshipped as hiya or shewhomustbeobeyed the amahagger are curious about the whiteskinned interlopers having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen\\nbillali the chief elder of one of the amahagger tribes takes charge of the three men introducing them to the ways of his people one of the amahagger maidens ustane takes a liking to leo and by kissing him and embracing him publicly weds him according to amahagger customs leo likewise grows very fond of her\\nbillali tells holly that he needs to go and report the white mens arrival to she in his absence some of the amahagger become restless and seize mahomed intending to eat him as part of a ritual hot pot realising what is about to happen holly shoots several of the amahagger mahomed dies in the effort to save him from the hot pot when a bullet passes through one of the amahagger and kills him as well in the ensuing struggle leo is gravely wounded but ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body to shield him from spears all seems lost as the amahagger resolve to kill ustane along with the white men but billali returns in the nick of time and declares that the three men are under the protection of she leos condition however worsens and he eventually nears death as ustane faithfully attends to him\\nthey are taken to the home of the queen which lies near the ruins of the lost city of kr a once mighty civilisation that predated the egyptians the queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of kr there holly is presented to the queen a white sorceress named ayesha her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it she who is veiled and lies behind a partition warns holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear but he is dubious when she shows herself however holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others a form of clairvoyance and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry but is notably unable to see into the future she tells holly that she has lived in the realm of kr for more than two millennia awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover kallikrates whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage later when holly inadvertently and secretly discovers ayesha in her hidden chamber he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead\\nthe next evening she visits leo to heal him but upon seeing his face she is stunned and declares him to be the reincarnation of kallikrates she saves him and becomes jealous of ustane the latter is

themselves from the power of ayeshas beauty and leo becomes bewitched in explaining her history ayesha shows leo the perfectly preserved body of kallikrates which she has kept with her but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid confident that leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover\\nin the climax of the novel ayesha takes the two men to see the pillar of fire passing through the ruined city of kr into the heart of the ancient volcano she is determined that leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever and that together they can become

of life but with this second immersion the lifepreserving power is lost and ayesha begins to revert to her true age holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the spirit of life spews death on occasion before their eyes ayesha withers away in the fire and her body shrinks the sight is so shocking that job dies in fright before dying ayesha tells leo forget me not i shall come again\\nbackground\\nsouth africa\\nin 1875 haggard was sent to cape town south africa as secretary to sir henry bulwer the lieutenantgovernor of natal haggard wrote in his memoirs of his aspirations to become a colonial governor himself and of his youthful excitement at the prospects the major event during his time in africa was britains annexation of the transvaal in 1877 haggard was part of the expedition that established british control over the boer republic and which helped raise the union flag over the capital of pretoria on 24 may 1877 writing of the moment haggard declared\\nhaggard had advocated the british annexation of the boer republic in a journal article entitled the transvaal published in the may 1877 issue of macmillans magazine he maintained that it was britains mission to conquer and hold in subjection not from thirst of conquest but for the sake of law justice and order however boer resistance to annexation and the resulting anglozulu war caused the government in london to withdraw from pursuing sovereignty over the south african interior haggard considered this to be a great betrayal by prime minister gladstone and the liberal party which no lapse of time ever can solace or even alleviate he became increasingly disillusioned with the realities of colonial africa victorian scholar patrick brantlinger notes in his introduction to she little that haggard witnessed matched the romantic depictions of the dark continent in boys adventure novels in the press and even in such bestselling explorers journals as david livingstones missionary travels and researches in south africa 1857\\nduring his time in south africa haggard developed an intense hatred for the boers but also came to admire the zulus however his admiration of the zulus did not extend to other african peoples rather he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary politics and philosophy such as those expressed by james hunt the president of the anthropological society of london the negro is inferior intellectually to the europeanand can only be humanised and civilised by europeans the analogies are far more numerous between the negro and apes than between the european and apes the victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the darker races made them the object of a civilising impulse in the european scramble for africa although disenchanted with the colonial effort haggard remained committed to this ideology he believed that the british alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty\\nreturn to britain\\nrider haggard returned to britain in 1881 at the time england was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the fin de sicle one of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline encapsulated in max nordaus degeneration 1895 barely half a century earlier thomas babington macaulay had declared the history of england to be emphatically the history of progress but latevictorians living in the wake of darwinian evolutionary theory had lost the earlier positivism of their age uncertainty over the immutability of britains historical identity what historian tim murray has called the threat of the past was manifested in the victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology haggard was greatly interested in the ruins discovered at zimbabwe in the 1870s in 1896 he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site declaring\\nby the time that haggard began writing she society had more anxiety about the role of women debates regarding the woman question dominated britain during the fin de sicle as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the new woman alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the womens movement and female liberation which challenged the traditional conception of victorian womanhood the role and rights of women had changed dramatically since the early part of the century as they entered the workforce received better education and gained more political and legal independence writing in 1894 haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry that  always in most cases  if they do not marry they become narrowed live a half life only and suffer in health of body and of mind he created the character of shewhomustbeobeyed who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the new woman in latevictorian england\\nconcept and creation\\naccording to haggards daughter lilias the phrase shewhomustbeobeyed originated from his childhood and the particularly hideous aspect of one ragdoll this doll was something of a fetish and rider as a small child was terrified of her a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience why or how it came to be called shewhomustbeobeyed he could not remember haggard wrote that the title she was taken from a certain rag doll so named which a nurse at bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge\\nin his autobiography haggard writes of how he composed she in six weeks in february and march 1886 having just completed jess which was published in 1887 haggard claimed that this was an intensely creative period the text was never rewritten and the manuscript carries but few corrections haggard went on to declare the fact is that it was written at white heat almost without rest and that is the best way to compose he admitted to having had no clear story in mind when he began writing\\nvarious scholars have detected a number of analogues to she in earlier literature according to brantlinger haggard certainly read the stories of edward bulwerlytton in particular a strange story 1862 which includes a mysterious veiled woman called ayesha and the coming race 1871 which is about the discovery of a subterranean civilisation similarly the name of the underground civilisation in she known as kr is derived from norse mythological romance where the deathbed of the goddess hel is called kr which means disease in old norse in she a plague destroyed the original inhabitants of kr\\naccording to haggard he wrote the final scene of ayeshas demise while waiting for his literary agent a p watt to return to his office once he had completed it he entered watts office and threw the manuscript on the table with the remark there is what i shall be remembered by\\na reference to she appears in lieutenant george wittons book scapegoats of the empire the true story of the bushveldt carbineers 1907\\npublication\\nshe was first published as a serial story in the graphic a large folio magazine printed weekly in london between october 1886 and january 1887 the serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by e k johnson an american edition was published by harper amp bros in new york on 24 december 1886 this included johnsons illustrations on 1 january 1887 a british edition was published by longmans green amp co without any illustrations it featured significant textual revisions by haggard he made further revisions for the british edition of 1888 which included new illustrations by maurice greiffenhagen and c h m kerr in 2006 broadview published the first edition of she since 1887 to reproduce the graphic serial text\\nnarrative revisions\\nhaggard contended that romances such as she or king solomons mines were best left unrevised because wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass however he made a number of alterations to the graphic version of she before its publication as a novel in 1887 one of the most significant was to the third chapter concerning the sherd which was substantially expanded from the original to include the tale of amenartas in uncial and cursive greek scripts facsimile illustrations were also included of an antique vase made up by haggards sisterinlaw agnes barber to resemble the sherd of amenartas a number of footnotes were also included containing historical references by the narrator haggard was keen to stress the historicity of the narrative improving some of the information about geography and about ancient civilisations in chapters 4 13 and 17\\nthe 1887 edition of the novel also features a substantially rewritten version of the hotpot scene in chapter 8 when mahomed is killed in the original serialisation the cannibal amahagger grow restless and hungry and place a large heated pot over mahomeds head enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him haggards stories were criticised at the time for their violence and he toned this scene down so that mahomed dies when holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the amahagger comparing the serial and novel editions of she stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original as a reflection of the intense burst of creativity in which haggard composed the story arguing that the style and grammar of the graphic edition is more energetic and immediate although as he noted it is also sometimes more flawed\\nhaggard continued to revise she for later editions the new edition of 1888 contains more than 400 minor alterations the last revision by haggard was in 1896\\ngenre\\nfantasy and science fiction\\nshe is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature coming around the time of the princess and the goblin 1858 by george macdonald william morris the wood beyond the world and the well at the worlds end and the short stories of lord dunsany it is marked by a strong element of the marvelous in the figure of ayesha a twothousandyearold sorceress and the spirit of the world an undying fire that confers immortality indeed haggards story is one of the first in modern literature to feature a slight intrusion of something unreal into a very real world  a hallmark of the fantasy genre similarly the carefully constructed fantasy history of she foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as the lord of the rings and the wheel of time series and which imparts a degree of security to the secondary world however the story of she is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call primary world reality with the lost kingdom of kr the realm ruled by the supernatural she a fantastic tertiary world at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative primary reality along with haggards prior novel king solomons mines she laid the blueprints for the lost world subgenre in fantasy literature as well as the convention of the lost race as brantlinger has noted of the novels importance to the development of the secondary world in fantasy literature haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction and yet his african quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies in his history of science fiction billion year spree brian aldiss notes the frequency with which ayeshas death in the pillar of fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers from haggard on crumbling women priestesses or empresses  all symbols of women as untouchable and unmakeable  fill the pages of many a scientific romance\\nadventure romance\\nshe is part of the adventure subgenre of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day along with works such as treasure island 1883 and prince otto 1885 by robert louis stevenson and jules vernes a journey to the center of the earth 1871 and around the world in eighty days 1875 she had an important formative effect on the development of the adventure novel indeed rider haggard is credited with inventing the romance of archaeological exploration which began in king solomons mines and crystallised in she one of the most notable modern forms of this genre is the indiana jones movie series as well as the tarzan novels by edgar rice burroughs and recently alan moores the league of extraordinary gentlemen 2000 in such fictional narratives the explorer is the hero with the drama unfolding as they are cast into the nostrum of the living past holly and leo are prototypes of the adventurer who has become a critical figure in modern fiction\\nimperial gothic\\nshe is also one of the central texts in the development of imperial gothic many latevictorian authors during the fin de sicle employed gothic conventions and motifs in their writing stressing and alluding to the supernatural the ghostly and the demonic as brantlinger has noted connected to imperialist adventure fiction these interests often imply anxieties about the stability of britain of the british empire or more generally of western civilisation novels like dracula and strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde present depictions of repressed foreign and demonic forces at the heart of the imperial polity in she the danger is raised in the form of ayesha herself\\nshes threat to replace queen victoria with herself echoes the underlying anxiety over european colonialism emblematic of the imperial gothic genre indeed judith wilt characterises the narrative of she in which the penetration into africa represented by holly leo and job suddenly suffers a potential counterattack from ayesha as one of the archetypal illustrations of the reverse colonalism motif in victorian gothic similarly she marks one of the first fictional examples to raise the spectre of the natural decline of civilisation and by extension british imperial power which would become an increasingly frequent theme in gothic and invasion literature until the onset of world war i\\nstyle\\nrider haggards writing style was much criticised in reviews of she and his other works his harshest critic was augustus moore who wrote god help english literature when english people lay aside their waverley novels and the works of defoe swift thackeray charlotte bront george eliot and even charles reade for the penny dreadfuls of mr haggard he added the man who could write he spoke to she can have no ear at all a more common sentiment was expressed in the anonymous review of she in blackwoods edinburgh magazine mr rider haggard is not an exquisite workman like mr robert louis stevenson but he has a great deal of power in his way and rougher qualities which are more likely perhaps to take the town than skill more delicate\\nmodern literary criticism has tended to be more circumspect as daniel karlin has noted that haggards style is frequently bathetic or clumsy cannot be denied but the matter is not so easily settled stauffer cites the passage in which holly meditates as he tries to fall asleep as emblematic of the charges against haggards writing in this scene holly lies down and\\nthe passage concludes with a wry remark from holly i at last managed to get to sleep a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative if anybody ever does may very probably be thankful according to stauffer the disarming deflation of the passage goes a long way toward redeeming it and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrators style tom pocock in rider haggard and the lost empire has also highlighted the literary framework that haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative referencing keats shakespeare and classical literature to imbue the story with a gothic sensibility yet as stauffer notes ultimately however one thinks of haggards plots episodes and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence\\nthemes\\nimperialism\\nshe is set firmly in the imperialist literature of the latevictorian period the socalled new imperialism marking the last quarter of the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of european colonies particularly on the african continent and was characterised by a seeming confidence in the merits of empire and european civilisation thus she invokes a particularly british view of the world as rider haggard projects concepts of the english self against the foreign otherness of africa one example occurs when holly is first ushered into the presence of ayesha walking into the chamber behind a grovelling billali who warns holly to follow his example or a surety she will blast thee where thou standest she stresses quintessential british qualities through the adventure of empire usually in contrast to foreign barbarism the notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of she who is herself a foreign colonising force in a sense then stauffer writes a single property line divides the realm of queen victoria and that of shewhomustbeobeyed two white queens who rule darkskinned natives of the african continent\\nrace and evolution\\nlike many of his victorian contemporaries rider haggard proceeded on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks and that britains imperial extensions into africa were a noble civilising enterprise although haggard wrote a number of novels that portray africans in a comparatively realistic light she is not among their number even in king solomons mines the representation of umbopa who was based on an actual warrior and the kukuanas drew upon haggards knowledge and understanding of the zulus in contrast she makes no such distinctions ayesha the english travellers and the ancient inhabitants of kr are all white embodiments of civilisation while the darker amahagger as a people illustrate notions of savagery barbarity and superstition nonetheless the racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear given that ayesha is in origin an ancient arabian leo is descended from and physically resembles a blond hellenistic greek and holly is said to resemble a baboon an animal that victorians typically associated with black africans critics such as wendy katz patricia murphy and susan gubar have discussed what they perceive as a strong racist undercurrent in she but andrew takes note of the ways in which the novel suggests deeper connections among the races an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid\\nthere is a strong darwinian undercurrent framing the representation of race in she stemming from haggards own interests in evolutionary theory and archaeology in particular the theme of racial degeneration appears in the novel moving into the fin de sicle late victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay in she this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in ayesha and the amahagger haggard represents the amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities a curious mingling of races originally descended from the inhabitants of kr but intermarried with arabs and africans racial hybridisation of any kind entailed degeneration to victorians a decline from the pure blood of the initial races and thus an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their kr ancestors may have imparted to them ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired for arabian am i by birth even al arab al ariba an arab of the arabs and of the race of our father yrab the son of khtan  of the true arab blood however judith wilt has argued that the novels starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of ayesha stepping into the pillar of fire the immortal she begins to wither and decay undergoing what wilt describes as the ultimate darwinian nightmare evolution in reverse\\nfemale authority and sexuality\\nwhen rider haggard first conceived of she he began with the theme of an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love although ostensibly a romance the novel is part of the wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in latevictorian britain many scholars have noted how she was published as a book in 1887 the year of queen victorias golden jubilee and adrienne munich argues that haggards story could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to victoria after fifty years of her reign indeed in her devotion to kallikrates two thousand years after his death ayesha echoes the longlasting fidelity of victoria to her husband albert however unlike the benign victoria the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of shewhomustbeobeyed whose autonomous will seemingly embodies victorian antifeminist fears of new women desiring absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in she so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic holly who has put his heart away from such vanity as womans loveliness ultimately falls upon his knees and worships ayesha as never woman was worshipped similarly although the masculine and chivalric leo is determined to reject ayesha for killing the devoted native girl ustane he too quickly falls under her will \\nin her role as the seductive femme fatale ayesha is part of a long tradition of male fantasy that includes homers circe shakespeares cleopatra and keatss la belle dame sans merci brantlinger identifies the theme of the white or at least lightskinned queen ruling a black or brownskinned savage race as a powerfully erotic one with its opposite being the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened at least with rape the figure of she both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty represented in her conquest of the enlightened victorians holly and leo the two englishmen embody the powers of manhood with leo a reflection of masculine physicality and holly a representation of mans intellectual strength but both are conquered by the feminine powers of she who rules as much through sexappeal as through sorcery immortality and will thus steven arata describes her as the veiled woman that ubiquitous nineteenthcentury figure of male desire and anxiety whose body is truth but a truth that blasts similarly sarah gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in ayesha as critical to the novels success unlike the women earlier victorian writers had idealised or excoriated she was neither an angel nor a monster rather she was an odd but significant blend of the two types  an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms\\nreception\\nafter its publication in 1887 she became an immediate success according to the literary world mr rider haggard has made for himself a new field in fiction comparing the novel to king solomons mines the review declared the book before us displays all the same qualities and we anticipate for it a similar popularity there is even more imagination in the later than in the earlier story it contains scenes of greater sensuous beauty and also of more gruesome horror the public opinion was equally rapturous in its praise\\nthe fantasy of she received particular acclaim from victorian readers and critics the review appearing in the academy on 15 january was impressed by the grownup vision of the novel declaring the more impossible it gets the better mr haggard does it his astonishing imagination and a certain vraisemblance verisimilitude french makes the most impossible adventures appear true this sentiment was echoed in the queen the ladys newspaper with the reviewer pronouncing that this is a tale in the hands of a writer not so able as mr haggard might easily have become absurd but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion\\nthe spectator was more equivocal in its appraisal of she the review described the narrative as very stirring and exciting and of remarkable imaginative power adding the ingenuity of the story is as subtle as ever romancer invented and from the day when leo and holly land on the coast of africa to the day when the pillar of fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal shewhomustbeobeyed the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course however the review took issue with the characterisation of she and the manner of her demise to the present writer there is a sense of the ludicrous in the end of she that spoiled instead of concluding with imaginative fitness the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of ayeshas death writing that in the insolence of her strength and loveliness she lifts herself up against the omnipotent therefore at the appointed time she is swept away by it vengeance more heavy because more long delayed strikes her in her proudest part  her beauty\\na number of reviews were more critical of haggards work although the reviewer of she in blackwoods edinburgh magazine considered it better than king solomons mines he opined mr rider haggard has not proved as yet that he has anything that can be called imagination at all it might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect but it is rather a failure in pen and ink the more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be the more absurd is the failure of them even more scathing was augustus moore in the may edition of time a monthly miscellany who declared in mr haggards book i find none of the powerful imagination the elaborate detail the vivid english which would entitle his work to be described as a romance rather it seems to me to be the method of the modern melodrama moore was particularly dismissive of the novels style and prose mr haggard cannot write english at all i do not merely refer to his bad grammar which a boy at a boarding school would deserve to be birched for it can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing but cared nothing for english undefiled haggards english was a common source of criticisms but moore was even dismissive of the character of she who widely garnered universal praise ayesha moore declares is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig concluding his review moore wondered at the success that had greeted she\\ndespite such criticism the reception that met she was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic andrew lang before the storys first publication i think she is one of the most astonishing romances i ever read the more impossible it is the better you do it till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet\\nmodern interpretations\\nfeminist literary historians have tended to define the figure of she as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the learned and crusading new woman in this view ayesha is a terrifying and dominant figure a prominent and influential rendering of the misogynistic fictive explorations of female authority undertaken by male writers that ushered in literary modernism ann ardis for instance views the fears holly harbours over ayeshas plan to return to england as being exactly those voiced about the new womans entrance in the public arena according to the feminist interpretation of the narrative the death of she acts as a kind of teleological judgement of her transgression of victorian gender boundaries with ardis likening it to a witchburning however to rider haggard she was an investigation into love and immortality and the demise of ayesha the moral end of this exploration\\nindeed far from being a radical or threatening manifestation of womanhood recent academics have noted the extent to which the character of she conforms to traditional conceptions of victorian femininity in particular her deferring devotion to kallikratesleo whom she swears wifely obedience to at the storys climax behold and she took his leos hand and placed it upon her shapely head and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground  behold in token of submission do i bow me to my lord behold and she kissed him on the lips in token of my wifely love do i kiss my lord ayesha declares this to be the first most holy hour of completed womanhood\\nlegacy\\nshe is one of the most influential novels in modern literature several authors including rudyard kipling henry miller graham greene jrr tolkien and margaret atwood have acknowledging its importance to their own and others writing with more than 83 million copies sold the novel is one of the bestselling fictional works of all time and has been translated into 44 languages according to stauffer she has always been rider haggards most popular and influential novel challenged only by king solomons mines in this regard the novel is cited in the psychoanalytical theories of sigmund freud and carl jung the latter describing the character of she as a manifestation of the anima figure\\nthe novel has had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre in particular directly giving rise to the lost civilisation tales of edgar rice burroughs and sir arthur conan doyle and the creation of mythologised locations such as shangrila tolkien recognised the importance of she to his own fantasy works especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative some scholars have also argued that she may have had a formative influence on galadriel in the lord of the rings ayeshas reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of galadriels mirror other characters in tolkiens legendarium also seem to have been influenced including shelob who is referred to as she and her in the text and the escape of the fellowship of the ring across the chasm in moria may be reminiscent of the escape across the chasm near the end of she similarly the hot pot ritual of haggards amahagger people appears to have been an inspiration or predecessor of the death of viserys targaryen in george r r martins a game of thrones and daenerys targaryen cersei lannister and especially melisandre of asshai priestess of the god rhllor might be seen as characters in the tradition beginning with ayesha indeed haggards characterisation of ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature most famously realised in the figure of the white witch jadis in c s lewiss the chronicles of narnia \\nkor and ayesha appear in alan moores nemo heart of ice the name ayesha is used in marvel comics for the female superheroine ayesha leader of the sovereign race also known as kismet her

blog of cameron slater which he started in 2005 slater the son of former national party president john slater claims whaleoil is a superblog attracting over one million unique visits every month he admitted at that time to suffering from depression and has a reputation for vitriol and anger he said in 2010 that he didnt care if people regarded him as stupid a bully or vicious but would resent being called a hypocrite\\nin january 2014 whaleoil was hacked some time after he posted a blog post with the headline feral dies in greymouth did world a favour three other children in this family had already been killed in accidents and the post provoked a furious public reaction some weeks later hager received an 8 gigabyte usb stick in the mail containing thousands of pages of emails hacked from slaters website hager contacted the hacker known as rawshark and persuaded him that putting the information in a book would provide something more lasting and of bigger value than releasing it on twitter hager says rawshark was motivated by his dislike of slater and that he secretly met the hacker in public parks to discuss how the information should be released he then spent a significant amount of time analysing the content and only published material which he believed was in the public interest he was careful to avoid releasing sensitive material about slater and others mentioned in the hacked emails which did not involve a significant public interest\\nproduction\\nthe production printing and distribution of the book was done in secret by craig potton publishing coowner of the publishing company robbie burton said it was one of the great and surreal and scary moments of my publishing career burton said the secrecy was necessary because they were wary that the book might annoy some people with deep pockets who might be inclined to revenge the book was produced very quickly by craig potton publishing where staff worked on it from thursday evening to the following tuesday once the book was finished first it was printed in secret in wellington before being shipped back to nelson and stored in a warehouse and then finally being sent unannounced to stores around the country\\nrelease\\ndirty politics was released at unity books in wellington on 13 august 2014 with a crowd of approximately 150 prior to the release of the book details of what it would be about were the subject of substantial speculation as the topic of the book was kept secret in order to avoid it being blocked from release by a court injunction\\nfour days after release it had sold about 10000 copies in addition to 1000 ebook sales robbie burton executive director of craig potton publishing said ive never seen anything like this before in terms of the speed at which its happening a week after release sales had reached approximately 15000 and by mid september sales were at almost 20000 the first two chapters are available free online\\ntwo weeks after the release of the book hager spoke at the fourday biennial writers amp readers festival in christchurch about 5000 people attended 57 events one of which was a public discussion called secrets spies and free speech featuring dirty politics author nicky hager guardian journalist luke harding and australian journalist richard king the discussion was mainly about the freedom of speech in western democracies\\nmain features\\nhager provides numerous incidents of dirty politics in the book he describes multiple email exchanges between cameron slater and national party spin doctor jason ede who works for prime minister john key up till august 2011 mr ede was employed by ministerial services and in effect was paid by the taxpayer hager says ede tried to avoid scrutiny by using a dynamic ip address one that changed frequently making it difficult for him to be identified when the book was published mr ede was employed by the national party rather than by john key but was still working from the prime ministers office he resigned the day before the election\\ndirty politics also describes numerous email contacts between cameron slater and judith collins who are longtime friends the email records span from 2009 to 2014 covering the entire time she was in cabinet one particular email shows that collins asked slater to edit her wikipedia page and sent him a new photo with the message cam any chance of a better photo going up eek it looks really bad slater appears to have obliged using the pseudonym jc press sec which was subsequently changed to polkad0t\\nin return slater also asked collins for favours the emails indicate slater asked ms collins to get a prisoner moved to a different prison while she was minister of corrections slater asked collins to get him moved because he was friends with the prisoners exwife who wanted the man moved further away from their daughter who had been visiting him in prison\\nthe more serious allegations in dirty politics are described below radio new zealand political editor brent edwards says that while the book is not always definitive\\nthe labour party website\\none of the main allegations is that during the 2011 election campaign cameron slater and jason ede took advantage of a badlyconfigured website to enter the database of the labour party website this enabled them to look at emails and personal details which were then used to attack the labour party 18000 emails lists of the partys donors and supporters and their creditcard transactions were downloaded the book reveals mr slater and mr ede both accessed the site more than once and then plotted how best to reveal the downloaded material on mr slaters blog slater did not deny he had accessed the website in may 2011 and said i was certainly into the backend of the labour partys website if they couldnt manage security of their website their credit card details and financial information about their membership well then they werent really fit for government at the time\\nhager alleges that material from the website breach was selectively released by slater starting from 12 june\\nin response to being accused of illegally accessing the labour website slater published a blog post titled my confession how i accessed the labour party web site in the post he shows how he claims to have accessed information on four labour party websites and denies allegations of hacking using easily accessible links he could view all the files on the web server including sensitive membership and credit card information which was unencrypted\\nmr key also claimed there was nothing wrong with jason ede accessing the labour party website because they left their website open he justified the action to radio new zealand by saying if the wallabies on tuesday night had left their starting lineup up on their website on their private website would the all blacks go and have a look the answer is yes the reason i know that is its happened\\nthe security intelligence service\\nanother allegation is that in 2011 the prime ministers office facilitated the release of confidential security intelligence service sis documents to cameron slater so he could use them to embarrass phil goff slater made an official information act oia request to the sis for confidential documents which confirmed the sis had briefed phil goff about suspected israeli spies who left the country after the second christchurch earthquake  after goff had said publicly he was not briefed slater was given access to documents within 24 hours  long before other media outlets who had also asked for them slaters emails described in dirty politics suggest he knew what was in the documents before they were released and that the oia would be expedited in unusually quick time goff believes this inside information could only have come from the sis director warren tucker or from staff in the prime ministers office\\nattacks on public servant\\nthe book also presents evidence which suggests that justice minister judith collins leaked the name of public servant simon pleasants to cameron slater pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at internal affairs and collins assumed he was responsible for leaking details of mr englishs accommodation payments to labour in 2009 slater then published a series of blog attacks on pleasants  who subsequently received a torrent of abuse including death threats pleasants denies ever leaking any information about english\\nnick bryant gerry brownlees press secretary is identified in dirty politics as the user of the pseudonym former hack to post anonymous comments on whaleoil encouraging cameron slaters campaign against pleasants on 23 august the new zealand herald reported it was able to confirm the use of mr bryants ministerial computer and subsequently revealed that hundreds of messages were sent from ministerial or government computers to the comments section of slaters blog the messages are linked to email addresses on government servers and ip addresses from which they were posted\\ncommercial hit jobs\\ndirty politics also refers to hacked emails which suggest slater allowed his website to be used for commercial hit jobs supplied by pr consultant carrick graham whose clients include tobacco and alcohol companies for instance slater has frequently used his whaleoil blog to attack professor doug sellman a leading authority on addiction and an outspoken critic of the alcohol industry posting blogs with pejorative titles such as confirmed doug sellman gone mad these were based on information supplied by carrick graham son of former national party member sir douglas graham hager says carrick grahams company facilitate communications paid slater 6555 a month and speculated that it was for him to do attack blogs\\nkatherine rich\\nformer national mp katherine rich the chief executive of the nz food and grocery council is implicated in the book emails show that information she passed to carrick graham was passed on to slater slater then used the information to attack health campaigners such as professor doug sellman who campaigns about liquor legislation and new zealand herald columnist wendyl nissen who writes about additives and healthy food\\nnew zealand allows 14 additives that have been banned or never allowed in the european union or the united states and in her role at the new zealand food and grocery council katherine rich has claimed all additives used in new zealand are safe ms nissen said she was attacked because katherine rich objected to her highlighting the use of artificial colours commonly used in soft drinks and processed foods and the fact many had been banned in other countries confirming his connection with katherine rich slater publicly acknowledged that she had paid him twice but claimed it was for speaking at conferences not for writing blog articles\\nhowever in 2012 the national government appointed rich to the board of the health promotional agency which runs campaigns to promote healthier lifestyles in this capacity katherine richs primary role is to promote public health suggesting her involvement with the food and grocery council means she has a conflict of interest once the allegations in dirty politics became public a group of 33 scientists and health practitioners were so concerned they wrote to john key asking him to investigate richs apparent conflict of interest\\ngreen party health spokesperson kevin hague said rich should resign arguing that katherine rich carrick graham and cameron slater have all been involved in a systematic undermining of health promotion in new zealand she cannot tenably remain on the board of that organisation rich responded by saying she had never been involved in undermining public health and found the claim very offensive she said she put her heart and soul into the health promotion agency and adhered to all parts of the crown entities act\\nnevertheless the auditorgeneral was asked to investigate and conducted a review of the hpas board minutes it declared we have not identified any particular matters before or decisions by the hpa board that might raise serious concerns about its management of conflicts of interest however the auditorgeneral acknowledged they did not interview ms rich nor did they investigate allegations in nicky hagers 2014 book dirty politics about things mrs rich is said to have done in her private capacity rich said she felt vindicated by the finding but the green party called for an additional investigation by the state services commission\\nfurther revelations\\nattacks on the serious fraud office\\non 30 august john key released an email written by slater in 2011 suggesting judith collins was also gunning for former serious fraud office sfo boss adam feely collins was the minister responsible for the sfo at the time and the email said any information that we can provide her collins on his feelys background is appreciated it was addressed to mark with the surname redacted and carrick graham\\nother emails released to fairfax media by rawshark appear to suggest that mark is former hanover finance director mark hotchin hotchin secretly paid slater and another right wing blogger cathy odgers to write attack posts undermining feely the sfo and the financial markets authority while they were investigating the collapse of hanover finance in 2011 slater wrote a series of highly critical blogs about feely in late 2011\\nrelease of emails on whaledump\\nprime minister john key characterised dirty politics as a cynically timed attack from a well known left wing conspiracy theorist in response to keys criticism that the books publication so close to the 2014 general election was designed to be a political bombshell hager says he published the material that was provided to him in march 2014 as soon as he could rather than being timed for maximum political damage hager says it was actually just the practicalities of how fast i could get it out\\nmr key went on to say the book makes all sorts of unfounded allegations and voters will see it for what it is he also accused nicky hager of joining a whole lot of dots that cant be connected key said hager didnt do what a true journalist would do he didnt go and check out the facts he didnt try and get that side of the story\\nin response hager spoke to his source to try to get back some of the emails that the book was based on in order to release them online the hacker known as rawshark apparently said leave this to me and began releasing the emails through an account on twitter whaledump the emails seem to back up many of the claims hager makes in the book the hacker also communicated with journalists using encryption to protect his identity he denied any political motivation but indicated a desire to take down this corrupt network\\nafter a series of email releases on the whaledump account cameron slater tried to take out a court injunction to prevent the media from reporting hacked information obtained from his whale oil blog media lawyer julian miles qc argued on behalf of the media outlets that the information was of huge public interest high court judge john fogarty agreed but granted an order stopping the hacker who was an unnamed defendant from publishing any more whaledumps although media were allowed to publish material they had already received in his judgement justice fogarty said that slaters case against the hacker was overwhelming and that taking information from his computer was akin to entering someones private property and taking their private papers he wrote there is no doubt at all that slater has a serious argument that the unknown hacker has committed a wrong or tort against him to which the common law will grant such remedies as can be practicably imposed\\non 4 september the original whaledump account was suspended by twitter soon afterwards the hacker rawshark reopened a twitter account with the username whaledump2 on 5 september after the release of a number of other documents online rawshark announced that he would no longer be releasing any information tweeting a number of messages\\nimpact\\nthe new zealand herald commentator john armstrong wrote hagers allegations are many and varied they are extremely serious armstrong points to the allegation of the involvement of national party personnel in hacking into the labour party database as the most serious and draws parallels with the watergate scandal david cunliffe leader of the labour party also describes the events portrayed in the book as akin to watergate\\nthe revelations in dirty politics have also been reported in international media under the headline new zealands own house of cards is collapsing the guardian newspaper said new zealanders are currently witnesses to an expos of unprecedented proportions also in the guardian new zealand journalist toby manhire wrote dirty politics has blown the national party election strategy dramatically off course propelling the campaign into uncharted territory its allegations have dominated news bulletins for the 10 days since its publication as accusations of dirty tricks smear campaigns and conspiracy sally in every direction in addition to the calls for judith collins to resign manhire suggested that john keys sparkling reputation may be contaminated by association with slaters toxic style\\ncameron slater subsequently laid a complaint with the police about the illegal hacking of his emails and made a separate complaint with the privacy commissioner over the release of the email by the prime minister\\nresignations\\njudith collins\\ncollins had been under pressure to resign earlier in the year over her involvement with chinese officials at oravida once dirty politics was published and collins alleged treatment of public servant simon pleasants came to light there were renewed calls for her resignation the public service association said her actions breached an important constitutional principle and minister collins must take responsibility for her actions and resign labour leader david cunliffe said mr key should fire ms collins because she has acted in a way that is unbecoming and unfit for a minister deputy prime minister bill english distanced himself from her behaviour by saying its not a style i like john key called her unwise but refused to take any action\\nas the pressure on collins mounted she avoided the media entirely for a few days then on 23 august she fronted up but refused to answer questions about her friendship with mr slater she declared she had no plans to resign and refused to acknowledge her behaviour was damaging the national party in any way a week later right wing blogger cathy odgers apparently sent the damning email to john keys office in which slater said collins was gunning for adam feely fairfax media journalist matt nippert who was investigating the hacked emails believes that odgers thought nippert was about to expos the connection between slater collins and feely he says odgers panicked and alerted the beehive to what may have been coming john key called a press conference the next day saturday 30 august 2014 at which collins resigned as a minister\\nin october the prime minister announced that collins would not be allowed to use the title honourable before her name unless she is cleared by the inquiry into her behaviour collins was reported to be appalled and seething that she heard about this decision through the media rather than being told personally by mr key\\njason ede\\njason ede was a central figure in dirty politics hager said ede drafted official information act requests on slaters behalf and was frequently in contact with the blogger about ways to discredit the labour party after the books release ede entirely avoided the media slater subsequently described him as squeamish and gutless for going to ground rather than talking to the media about their relationship\\nede resigned from his position as a media researcher for the national party the day before the election announcing his resignation after 11 years loyal service to the national party john key said\\nblogger david farrar said he thought ede had resigned voluntarily and not due to the books publication however hager said he was sceptical about the reasons behind edes departure\\ninspector general inquiry into the release of sis information\\non 1 september the inspectorgeneral of intelligence and security cheryl gwyn announced she would conduct an indepth and robust inquiry in response to claims that details of a briefing between the head of the sis with former labour leader phil goff were given to cameron slater gwyn promised a comprehensive investigation saying the scale of the inquiry is significant  it involves access to a variety of it systems documents phone records and so forth i then need to analyse that information discard what is irrelevant and then take into account the evidence from those summoned she said the inquiry was in recognition of public interest that the sis may have been used for political purposes\\nthe results on the inquiry were released on 25 november 2014 three months later ms gwyn found that the sis gave information to john keys office from where his deputy chief of staff phil de joux passed it on to another john key employee jason ede mr ede contacted cameron slater and they then discussed how an official information act request for the information should be worded slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided slater with draft blog posts attacking mr goff cameron slater subsequently used the information to attack former labour leader phil goff on his blog\\nms gwyn concluded that former sis director warren tucker provided incomplete inaccurate and misleading information to cameron slater and to prime minister john key and failed to take adequate steps to maintain the agencys political neutrality in the process ms gwyn said the sis had effectively delivered mr slater an exclusive story while denying other media the same information\\nthe report went on to say that warren tucker having released inaccurate information that was predictably misinterpreted the then director of the service had a responsibility to take positive steps to correct the interpretation but failed to do so gwyn further said that these errors resulted in misplaced criticism of the thenleader of the opposition hon phil goff mp ms gwyn recommended that current sis director rebecca kittredge should apologize to mr goff on behalf of the sis after reading the report ms kitteridge went a step further and apologised to the new labour leader andrew little and prime minister john key as well\\nin a blog post responding to the release of the inquirys findings hager wrote that\\nhe finishes his blog post by noting that many of the other components of dirty politics have yet to be investigated fully\\ninquiry into collins amp sfo\\nthere were also calls for a wide ranging inquiry into the national partys dealings with cameron slater labours finance spokesman david parker described the revelations in dirty politics as just the tip of the iceberg and laid a formal complaint with police into allegations that judith collins perverted the course of justice david cunliffe said there should be a commission of inquiry into all national ministers dealings with slater greens party coleader metiria turei said there should be a royal commission winston peters said a full royal commission of inquiry would be a bottom line in any negotiations by new zealand first in the formation of a government after the election\\nthe prime minister agreed to an inquiry but limited its scope to only one issue  the allegations that collins undermined the director of the serious fraud office adam feeley in 2011 he appointed former high court judge lester chisholm to conduct the inquiry david cunliffe felt this was an inadequate response and said labour should be consulted on the terms of reference for the inquiry there is a well embedded constitutional convention that requires the prime minister to consult with the leader of the opposition this close to an election on a matter this serious i would expect to be consulted on the terms of reference key refused to consult labour over the terms saying were not going on a witch hunt\\non 25 november 2014 the inquiry released its findings that although there were two independent efforts to undermine former serious fraud office chief executive adam feeley there was no evidence that collins participated however judge chisholm had quite limited access to slaters accomplices or to relevant information he only interviewed two of the five people who were party to the email that led to ms collins resignation  cameron slater and carrick graham he didnt talk to hanover boss mark hotchin or hong kongbased blogger cathy odgers chisholm also had no access to ms collins facebook communications which she deleted in 2013 he also did not have access to her parliamentary landline calls or to cell phone calls from slater to her justice chisholm noted that the absence of telephone records for mr slaters calls is surprising given that both ms collins and mr slater confirmed that they phoned each other often\\nnevertheless collins felt vindicated and said\\nin regards to collins relationship with cameron slater she said he remained a family friend although she felt incredibly let down by him\\non opinion polls prior to the 2014 election\\nalthough it was difficult to gauge the new zealand publics views on the contents of dirty politics television new zealands vote compass tool provided a rough indication based on over 13000 responses up to 25 august 2014 vote compass suggests that 33 thought there was none or little truth to the claims in the book 49 said there some or a lot of truth and 18 didnt know in terms of the effect of the book on voting intentions 56 said it wouldnt have an effect 15 said it would have a little effect 11 some 10 a lot and 8 said they didnt know there is also some evidence to suggest that the number of people who believed the books claims had grown over time\\na number of polls were held during the intense publicity surrounding dirty politics and showed the national party losing support towards the end of august 2014 two weeks after the release of the book national was still way ahead at 508 but down 43 on previous figures john key also lost ground as preferred prime minister the radio new zealand poll of polls an arithmetical average of the four most recent major polls showed national had slid below 50 to 491 as at 29 august\\nthe prime minister frequently tried to deflect media interest from dirty politics arguing that most people were more interested in other election issues once judith collins resigned three polls including the herald digipoll survey all showed national support had gone back up to 50 while labour continued to drop at his first campaign appearance in the epsom electorate on 6 september key said the polls were showing the public had moved on new zealand herald columnist john armstrong noted that collins was pushed into resigning and said when key sacked judith collins the headlines screamed national in chaos in fact removing collins was the vital first move in getting nationals campaign back on track hagers book looks like having no material impact on the outcome of the election\\non the 2014 election\\njohn keys national party was reelected to government after it received 4704 of the party vote in the september 2014 general election judith collins retained her seat in papakura but her winning margin over the labour candidate was cut by half  from 9890 in the 2011 election to 5119 in 2014 after the election collins was not reinstated to a ministerial position and was relegated to the backbenches\\npolitical journalist andrea vance commented that dirty politics didnt hurt national  in fact all the evidence points to a lift but it did harm labour labour leader david cunliffe commented that the focus on dirty politics and spying on new zealanders had actually hurt the left you would think the impact would be on the government party responsible but the reality is that if one is not able to get the airtime because others are dominating it that impacts the opposition as well cameron slater blogged that dirty politics had no impact on the election because new zealanders simply dont care\\non john keys integrity\\nthroughout the weeks that the allegations of dirty politics swirled in the media prime minister john key tried to swat them away claiming nicky hager was little more than a screaming leftwing conspiracy theorist after national won the 2014 election key continued with this dismissive approach once mps returned to parliament when asked by green party leader russel norman how many times he had spoken to or texted cameron slater key replied never in my capacity as prime minister an editorial in the new zealand herald said this revealed a cavalier disregard for the accountability and integrity of his office after key denied judith collins the right to be called the honourable despite other cabinet members resigning in disgrace and keeping the title even cameron slater thought this reflected badly on mr key describing mr keys decision as a silly mistake he said starting off the term with an arrogant and petulant act like that is unbecoming and foreshadows illwill dogging him in this term\\nkeys integrity took another hit after release of the report by inspectorgeneral of intelligence and security cheryl gwyn into the release of information by sis director warren tucker despite the revelations in gwyns report key claimed no one in his office had done anything wrong and refused to apologise to mr goff new zealand herald columnist john armstrong described the report as hugely embarrassing and said the key administration has plumbed new depths of arrogance and contempt for the notion of politicians being accountable for their actions fairfax political journalist andrea vance wrote in response to the inquiries findings that key takes handsoff to a disturbing extreme she further wrote it stretches credibility to suggest key  and his chief of staff wayne eagleson  bear no responsibility for the conduct of de joux and ede\\na few days later mr key had to admit in parliament that he had been communicating with cameron slater by text about gwyns report prior to its release given that slater is perceived in john armstrongs words as the second mostdespised figure in new zealand politics after kim dotcom parliamentarians and media commentators were surprised that key was still in touch with him armstrong said by acknowledging his links with slater key compromised his assurance that he had no knowledge of the dirty tricks operation bryce edwards said that key could not afford to cut ties with slater out of fear of what could happen if slater became his enemy matthew hooten said this could lead to john keys downfall as he risks cameron slater going off the deepend and revealing the full extent of his relationship with the prime minister himself the prime ministers office with a number of john keys ministers with a fair bunch of the backbenchers and with some senior party officials\\non democracy amp perceptions of corruption\\nin his column in the new zealand herald dr bryce edwards lecturer in political studies at otago university expressed concern about the impact of dirty politics on the publics confidence in public institutions and the integrity of governance he said the official reports in response to the inquiries generated by the book should serve as a wakeup call about the health of new zealand democratic process in the national business review rob hosking supports this view writing the plain fact is the countrys security service got caught up in the political games of election 2011 willfully or accidentally it became a political arm of the party in power and not as it should be a neutral government agency\\nin his column vernon small warns that spindoctors are acquiring too much political sway and see their main job as being to protect the government from the opposition\\non science and public health\\nobesity expert dr boyd swinburn professor of population nutrition and global health at the university of auckland says dirty politics and conflicts of interest in government appointments are having a detrimental impact on public health swinburn said when tony ryall appointed former national mp katherine rich to the health promotion agency hpa in 2012 he ignored an irreconcilable conflict of interest  rich is chief executive of the food and grocery council which lobbies for the alcohol tobacco and groceryfood industries whereas the primary responsibility of the hpa is to improve the health of new zealanders\\ndr swinburn also believes the views of scientists are being suppressed by attack campaigns driven by large commercial interests in new zealand he points to tony ryalls dismissal of a letter from more than 30 senior publichealth experts calling for an investigation of richs role on the hpa board\\npolice investigation into the identity of the hacker\\nraid on hagers home\\nin october 2014 five police officers went to nicky hagers home with a search warrant and spent ten hours looking for information the alleged purpose of the search was to try to find out the identity of the hacker rawshark who hacked into cameron slaters computer to obtain the emails and other material on which dirty politics was based they took away computers harddrives phones cds an ipod and a camera police told hager he is a witness rather than a suspect of the inquiry hager said it seems like a very strange level of resources just for a witness stuff noted that similar raids had not been made on national party staffer jason ede who allegedly hacked into the labour party website\\nsuccessful legal challenge of raid\\nin response to the police search a legal defence fundraiser for hager was set up on the website give a little by former young labour leader meg bates who described hager as a hero who exposed a twisted web of power and influence in new zealand politics as at april 2016 over 65000 had been donated to the fund despite attempts to shut it down and criticism from slaters sympathisers\\nanother legal defence fundraiser was set up by the freedom of the press foundation in an article publicising the fundraiser at the intercept and detailing the police raid on hagers house glenn greenwald and ryan gallagher wrote that the raid could have been partially motivated by a desire to investigate whether hager had received any information from the nsa leaks as at 18 november the foundation fundraiser had raised over 21000\\na legal team led by julian miles qc media lawyer steven price and barrister felix geiringer gathered round nicky hager who is seeking a judicial review of the police action steven price said our case will be that the police didnt properly consider nicky hagers right to protect his confidential sources commenting on the case law professor ursula cheer said weve never really had a case like this before and weve never really had any of these public interest issues tested\\non 30 october 2014 it was reported that an updated edition of john roughans biography john key portrait of a prime minister had a new chapter on the election which mentioned that john key claimed to have been told the identity of the hacker rawshark he did not pass the name on to the author of the biography asked by reporters about the comment and whether he given the information to the police a spokesperson for key said that while he thought he knew the identity of the hacker he cannot be certain the spokesperson also said that key had no involvement in the police inquiry\\nin december 2015 the high court in wellington declared the warrant used to search hagers house fundamentally unlawful the judge criticised the police saying the way detectives went about obtaining the warrant was not the type of facilitation that i consider the search and surveillance act anticipates\\nin march 2016 hager travelled to the high court in auckland to collect belongings taken by police during the search in october 2014 his belongings were in a sealed container at the high court awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge police also destroyed a hard drive which contained copies of hagers data hager commented that\\non 12 june 2018 hager accepted an apology and compensation for substantial damages from the new zealand police for the 2014 raid on his home during the investigation into the hacking that led to the dirty politics book the settlement also included the police acknowledging that they had accessed hagers personal banking data\\non the media\\nafter the police raid on nicky hagers house the labour partys acting leader david parker pointed out that journalists have a right to protect their sources and said there was a growing number of cases in which the police were being called in to investigate the media he said the police had searched media offices after mr keys teapot tapes conversation with john banks and the serious fraud office had demanded the national business review hand over documents related to the collapse of south canterbury finance parker argued that the search of nicky hagers house amounted to intimidation and said if the media are not free of undue intrusion by state agencies or have too cosy a relationship with political parties they cannot do what the fourth estate is meant to do in an editorial the new zealand herald agreed and said the police raid over such a minor crime was not a good look for the police the editorial went on to say the effect of such raids is to intimidate such people from approaching media to disclose uncomfortable truths\\nin reviews of political events in 2014 numerous commentators emphasised the impact of dirty politics the new zealand heralds david fisher named nicky hager as a finalist for new zealander of the year russell brown said dirtypolitics was word of the year 2014 martin bradbury criticised john key for his involvement with cameron slater but also took aim at the media for their part in dirty politics arguing that many of these media outlets also worked hand in glove with nationals black ops team andrew geddis challenged the sunday star times for giving judith collins a biweekly column once she resigned from cabinet arguing the paper was essentially choosing money over ethical concerns reviewing these various commentaries bryce edwards said there is a growing call for the socalled dirty

paragraphs and sentences that have deep meanings in fact the whole novel is a series of short sections or vignettes each vignette is part of a stream of consciousness from one of the multiple narrators the different types of vignettes include diary entries emails newspaper articles holy textsprayers and dialogues to name a few also there is a multitude of characters who make quick appearances in different spots throughout the novel the randomness and fragments of thought add to the overall theme of chaos and the meaninglessness of everything in life the main subthemes of the novel are death aids war art and violence the novel also offers narratives on the inadequate representation of the realities of aids and the lebanon civil war in the mass media alameddine achieves this by citing fictional examples told from the first person point of view on the exploitation of the sick and the disregard for human life in war these examples help reflect the insufficiency of monolithic narratives of aids and war often peoples harrowing personal experiences are not accounted for in the news or in history books alameddines central purpose for this novel is to portray the meaninglessness of life and to show that the only thing that is certain in life is death\\ncharacters\\nin koolaids rabih alameddine includes numerous characters that are connected through a series of short narrations there are four main narrators mohammad samir samirs mother and kurt that the readers are introduced to the narrations seem to be laid out sporadically because alameddine alternates between each of these four and they are not given in chronological order he also includes several subplots and various vignettes although the narrators are the main characters of the book there are several dialogues in which celebrities interact with gods from other cultures these correspond to the randomness of the passages well a recurring trend with most of the characters is that they die throughout the course of this novel the main causes of death being aids or the violence of the war none of alameddines characters have ever existed and as a confirmation the author did state i anticipate readers who will imagine characters herein to correspond to real persons they do not everything is a creation of my twisted imagination vii\\ncharacters in dialogues\\nthese dialogues between famous people from different cultures take place four different times throughout the novel in each of these dialogues there are six characters that appear every time arjuna krsna eleanor roosevelt krishnamurti julio cortzar and tom cruise other characters that are seen in these dialogues are jesus mame dennis and jalaleddine rumi the main theme of each of these dialogues is the search for the meaning of life before each of the dialogues the same phrase appears an hour later arjuna and his charioteer krsna on the battlefield they are now joined by eleanor roosevelt krishnamurti julio cortzar and tom cruise who looks a little lost 37\\nother important characters\\nin no particular order\\nthemes amp motifs\\ndeath\\nthe novel centers around wars in lebanon as well as the aids epidemic in the united states two fronts where death occurs on a regular basis alameddine talks about death in various ways describing the deathbeds of those suffering from aids as well as the sometimes instant deaths of those in lebanon alameddine talks about death in his novel often in peculiar ways which is similar to the peculiar set up of the book for instance in three different cases alameddine writes about death in very different ways i am back in beirut in a stable hiding he asks me what i am doing i tell him i killed him he is lying on the ground dead we both look at his body p\\xa075 in this vignette which is almost a complete tangent like many of the vignettes throughout the story are the narrator has a dream in which he kills his father this surreal experience is not uncommon throughout the book nor is its correlation to death the narrator seems to be almost fascinated at the sight of his dead fathers body and the experience seems to be treated lightly often alameddine treats situations of death with humor this can be seen on page 158 where the narrator talks about a poem he wanted to write on his deathbed and then makes a comment about how he is unable to because he could not write as good as thirteenth century writer jalaleddine rumi another notion of death touched on in the novel is the idea of the living dead on page 95 there is a vignette about an aids patient with a brainstem issue with the narrator saying brain stem you say by that definition juan should have been declared dead long before he even got to the hospital again on page 159 a similar scenario comes up kurt was snoring i sat next to his bed i did not want to disturb him he looked dead already he opened his eyes suddenly in these two quotes alameddine brings up the idea of death as a subjective topic in a way alameddine lets the reader decide or at least stokes the fires of debate as to what death means scientifically emotionally and otherwise it seems that in alameddines eyes death is not something determined by doctors but can come sooner and often does another mention of death in the novel comes in the form of the four horsemen of the apocalypse from the book of revelation the four horsemen take part in several dialogues throughout the book which at times are humorous another look at alameddines sometimes comedic take on the subject\\naids vs war\\nthe two major settings in alameddines novel are lebanon and san francisco both of which were facing distinct cultural crises at the time being described in the novel lebanon was ravished with civil war while san francisco was ravished with the aids epidemic throughout the novel certain parallels are made but the author also makes a point to let the reader know that the problems happen in both places more specifically he makes it known that aids and issues with homosexuality affect people in lebanon and the war affects people outside of the war zone one very important comparison that alameddine makes throughout the book is the idea of control in regards to aids and lebanon with the aids patients the reader is taken through the sickness and the complete loss of control that the patients face with their bodies basically shutting down from within this is eerily similar to the loss of control that the citizens of lebanon face as their country is divided from within while outside forces like syria and israel take advantage of their situation much like the virus and consequent illnesses that actually end up killing the patients\\nsex\\nthe relation of sex to danger and violence whether it be through the war in lebanon or through aids is ever present throughout the book the first sexual experience that we read about is samirs loss of virginity which is not only graphic but uses language illustrating painful sex in the garage of the apartment building described as dark damp and putrid 15 and samir felt a wet finger penetrate him it felt uncomfortable 15 georges tells samir that he is a natural and samir repeats i like it i try to help him but it gets too painful 15 as georges climaxes the sound of gunfire erupts again 15 the scene conjures the image of a boy living everyday life in a conflicted environment in physical pain from the penetration but excited at what is happening with georges he doesnt quite know what to so but is learning as he goes the gunfire being simultaneous with georegess orgasm is significant of the war being ever present samir then runs upstairs to watch the war from the roof and is almost struck by a bullet flying at his crotch it could have been about to hit him anywhere but the author chooses to have it almost strike him there inevitably this reference is linked to the sex moments earlier calling to question if the authors statement is about gay sex being unsafe at this time like dodging a bullet if the author is discussing sex between gay men as dangerous it is because of the danger of having sex in relation to the aids epidemic the epidemic was random in terms of who lived and who died kind of like war survival in relation to the disease and the war was a matter of luck not based on precautions or actions\\nwhen mohammad meets scott he had a thing for him and desires him greatly he takes him to his art studio and shows him his paintings watching as scott was admiring his work mohammad says that the scene was turning him on 13 but scott starts talking and describing the painting relating to mohammads life so he no longer wanted to have sex in fact they never fucked ever 13 however mohammad loves scott more than anyone in the world and scotts last words were of his love for mohammad in this instance of intense love we see desire but then no sex alalmeddine is perhaps implying that relationships of the most significant kind are about more than sex and that sex is in fact not necessary in a deep loving relationship \\nthe one straight sexual relationship the we read of is in the context of an affair in lebanon between a powerful political figures wife and a warlord she falls in love with him and he seems to love her but still the war and violence is the theme of their relationship and sex at one point they are lying in bed and she feels a gun under the pillow and he tells her that he has many more guns he takes five and lays them on her stomach and says she has to take one with the loaded gun he massages her 181 and the barrel penetrateshe explores with the gunhe looks into her eyes she is his 181 when she points the gun at his head he smiles and performs fellatio on the gun then she looks into his eyes he is hersshe orgasms 181 this scene is again like the loss of virginity scene dangerous and has conflicting images but still expresses love the fact that they are using a loaded gun as a sex toy can speak to the questionable aspect of the affair the pretenses of their love or just that he is a warlord depending on ones reading of the scene regardless even in heterosexual sex we see the link between violence and sex\\nif ever there was a doubt to the narrators intentions we are given a quote by norman mailer saying there is nothing safe about sex there never will be 178 linking sex to the dangers of aids not just war there is a scene in which the narrator walks to the badlands to find someone to have sex with and walked out with a boytook him home and fucked him silly 176 just the notion of going to find a random person to have sex with is risky but in the novel it coincides with the culture the use of the word fuckas opposed to make love or have sex makes the act purely physical and takes the emotion out of it the next morning the boy wakes up and realizes he has slept with an hivpositive man and gets really upset saying that he did not know in an act of defiance the narrator goes to the tattoo parlor and has an hiv tattooed on his chest so that now no one can claim he never told them 177 art news asked him to pose for a picture of the tattoo thinking that it was an artistic statement this example of confusion and repercussion gives the reader incite into the domination of the disease on daily life furthermore we are shown an example of how the outside community cannot understand the struggles of a gay man with aids even when he attempts to make it very clear\\nart\\nart in the novel illustrates the struggle with aids a community and a means of identity perhaps the simplest connection to aids is in the fear of death and the creation of immortality as an artist one can be remembered leaving something physical behind that will be protected or kept samir visits mohammad and scott and is inspired by mo a nickname given to him by other characters that he dislikes and paints a portrait of their friend juan who just died 140 he then paints steve who also just died 140 by painting people who have just died the painter preserves the subject regardless of the quality the paintings are a tribute to their memory scott acknowledges this ability in art and asks mo to use his ashes in a painting specifically so that he may be immortal 103 he is not only going to carry on through an image but knows that people will look at a painting of him and it will most likely be appreciated and never destroyed in asking for his ashes on canvas he will be able to actually physically remain a part of peoples lives granted this is a hard task for mo who ultimately paints his best friend into a peaceful lotus blossom scott epitomizes the theory behind using art as a refuge and as preserving oneself art is a part of kurts death wish as well when he asks mo to take his paintings he says i know theyre not worth much you can take them while i go on my trip 140 kurt lying on his death bed leaves his work to mo who is his lover but also in the same situation as a part of the gay art community mo knows that kurt means he cannot take his paintings after he dies but that he wants them to remain somewhere through looking at the fact that the characters of the art community think about where there art will end up after their death gives the feeling that perhaps while alive they were thinking of the same thing that to an extent the art could preserve them\\nregarding the art community there is a whole community of characters with shared experiences who all either paint or attend shows and exhibitions and admire each others artwork the community provides a place to express emotion meet peers and reconcile life to an extent samir goes to one of mohammads exhibits in dc with his lover mark and is the only one to understand the subjects of the paintings he tells the art dealer that he has never seen mohammads abstract paintings but the dealer is confused because the thinks that these paintings are abstract samir replies but they are the sides of our houseshe painted them beautifully 101 he says that he had captured lebanon 101 mohammad jokingly is upset with samir for ruining his secret but is also excited to have found someone to relate to the scene shows first that the community developed through art and second another way in which art is used these pictures are not preserving a dead friends memory but they are preserving mohammad and samirs wartorn homeland without violence involved through the exhibit scene one is shown again the ignorance of an outside culture looking in by the viewers willingness to assume that the pictures were abstract as opposed to merely asking for a description which mohammad says no one did\\nart is also used to show acceptance and exclusion in society on pages 48 to 49 mohammad is describing showing a picture to his father who asks him how come you always draw mencome back and show me when you have drawn some women 49 mohammad follows his fathers advice and eagerly draws a copy of goyas nude maja he does not know how to draw the face and decides to improvise and then returns to show his father his father slaps him because the face looks like mohammads mother mohammad is called a pervert by his father at age seven for his attempt to replicate a painting and using his own concepts of reality to create his artwork later his painting sold for 300000 and was titled my mother as the nude maja almadene gives a character who uses classic art and makes it his own but is rejected for it one sees mohammads inability to really own a shared culture without being critiqued as well as sexuality again affecting mohammad negatively\\nstyle and structure\\nkoolaids is a very complicated novel both stylistically and in terms of its structure the book is divided into a series of vignettes that are presented in a seemingly disjointed manner that serves to reflect the great chaos brought by the lebanese civil war and the aids epidemic the main vignettes deal with the main characters such as mohammed and samir but there are many others that introduce and reintroduce characters creating a disjointed reading experience not found in many novels many of these small episodes do not even deal with tangible characters but rather figments of one of the other characters imagination other times the vignettes contain detailed accounts of personas such as the lovers from opposite sides of the conflict in beirut who persistently remain unidentified the reader really does not get a true idea of how all the scenes relate to each other until the end of the book and no more new information is being presented\\nstream of consciousness\\nthe novel though stylistically unique has very much in common with the modernist literary style stream of consciousness pioneered by authors such as james joyce william faulkner and virginia woolf stream of consciousness is effectively an unending interior monologue that tries to portray the constant thought process of the lead character sensory stimuli that the character encounters or random thoughts that might pop into his head are all incorporated into the narration to create a story that gives the reader a better impression of the characters state of mind than other styles books that fall into this category are often very liberal in terms of syntax and grammar to reflect the characters rambling thought patterns \\nkoolaids fits many of these criteria but takes the notion of a stream of consciousness to a new level well known stream of consciousness works usually follow very few characters such as virginia woolfs mrs dalloway which follows two character clarissa dalloway and septimus warren smith through an average day in their lives other novels such as faulkners the sound and the fury follow a team of characters that are closely linked in this case all associated with a single southern plantation koolaids follows more than just a team of characters as stated above there are the identifiable main characters mohammed and samir these characters do know each other and interact but there are many others that are followed that only have in common the fact that their lives were impacted by either aids or the lebanese civil war whereas a novel like mrs dalloway follows more than one character in order to contrast the minds of sane person with a person on the brink of mental illness koolaids does not have such an understandable reason for having multiple and often unidentified narrators this conforms to the books theme of chaos the loss of identity experienced in modern lebanese society and the san francisco gay community following the civil war and the aids epidemic\\nanother way koolaids differs from established stream of conscious literature is through its lack of structurally sequenced time established stream of consciousness works such as the sound and the fury may be literarily complicated but they generally have some identifiable chronology koolaids goes back and forth over the course of more than twenty years from the childhoods of various characters through to the death of mohammed occurring in the present this can be confusing at times but like the other vignettes it can be understood at the end and a unified story becomes apparent\\na place where koolaids does seem to conform to the style of stream of consciousness is in its lack of a conclusion the novel ends with mohammed dying unceremoniously much as the sound and the fury ends abruptly with the compsons driving around town in a decaying carriage\\npostmodern literature\\nthe link between the style of koolaids and stream of consciousness literature makes more sense when the novels status as a postmodernist work is taken into account postmodern literature as suggested by its name was a reaction to the norms of modernist literature but drew much influence from the stream of conscious style these books tend to explore multiple levels of an inner state of consciousness reject a distinction between high and low culture and an acknowledgement that more and more of society is becoming commoditized and fetishized they also reject the modernist notion that all existence has an underlying meaning or cause see existentialism such as the notion that the decay of the compsons in the sound and the fury was related to the fall of the american south many works also employ a sense of intertextuality and selfreferentiality not found in the literature of previous generations \\nkoolaids falls into many of the postmodern criteria the following of multiple seemingly unrelated characters streams of consciousness relates to trying to display multiple levels of inner consciousness the novel contains various extremely graphic sexual scenes that sit alongside beautifully narrated accounts of the characters lives by implying that sexual and violent scenes can be incorporated into a respectable novel alameddine is effectively erasing any notion that high and low art should be kept separate and stating that all is connected another way that koolaids conforms to the postmodern ideal is in its lack of a deeper current unifying all the tragedy it contains the only thing unifying the events in the book is the notion of chaos the very opposite of meaning and order a final way that alameddines novel conforms to postmodern literature is through the selfreferentiality of some of the narrators an example of this is on page 114 where the narrator says hey you in a direct call to the reader another more subtle selfreference begins on page 221 and continues through page 231 in this the narrator describes a play he wanted to write that described the workings of lebanese society in a very concise way the play that follows seems to make references to actual characters spoken about in other parts of the novel a nod to the great intertextuality found within postmodernist works the book may effectively be considered a postmodern stream of conscious novel stylistically it draws heavily from that modernist technique but at the same time it rejects the ideals of modernism in favor of the postmodernist standard koolaids remains very hard to classify due to its intricate plots and vignettes masterfully crafted by alameddine its existentialist message can at times be very hard to decipher\\ncultural and political references\\nhivaids in koolaids\\none of the major cultural references in the novel koolaids is the disease hivaids almost every character in the story is related to the disease in some way alameddines characters constantly refer to hivaids related terms and the disease itself throughout the novel sometimes it is slight and other times it is quite obvious the characters seem to have a nonchalant way of approaching the disease at times it even seems like they do not care to inform the reader of the terms they use\\nthe first reference to hivaids is a ks lesion which is found on page 8 a ks legion is a kaposis sarcoma lesion which form on various places of a person in a later stage of hivaids the lesions are most visible and recognizable on skin and therefore give away the hivaids status of the person who has them those who read the book and have no former experience with hivaids may not understand the terms in this way of writing alammedine has a select audience that he writes to other hivaids vocabulary used throughout the novel are cmv retinitis cytomegalovirus retinitis in which the infected person loses his or her eyesight one of the narrators refers to this condition when talking of his friend who was an artist who stopped painting due to cmv retinitis in this reference he sort of describes the condition by saying that his friend couldnt see worth shit due to cmv retinitis 10 one of the most impactful references to hivaids in the novel is short nine sentences long it says\\nso billy shakespeare was queer ronnie was the greatest president in history right up there on mount rushmore aids is mankinds greatest plague israel only kills terrorists american never bombed lebanon jesus was straight judas and he were just friends roseannes parents molested her as an infant menachem begin and yasser arafat deserved their nobles and gaetan dugas stated the aids epidemic12\\nthis short paragraph gives a good take on the controversies of societys view of history especially of hivaids  the lines are meant to encourage the reader to challenge these assumptions or accept them for example shakespeares sexuality is a debate that has been raging for years ronnie is ronald reagan and the statement of him being the best president is very contentious in koolaids reagan is regularly referenced and not in a positive light the gaetan dugas sentence reflects on how many people and some falsely still think that dugas started the entire epidemic with these obviously inflammatory remarks alameddine grabs the readers attention and starts the novel off with an interesting section which sets the mood for much of the book\\nhivaids seems to just pop up throughout the novel and its notation is just as sporadic as other subjects in koolaids treatments and symptoms are mentioned without serious thought and have a dark tone the narrators talk about hivaids as if it is this modern day apocalypse that everyone will soon have when oxygen saturation is referenced the narrator says ox sat i bet you dont know what ox sat is oxygen saturation 47 yet again it is mentioned in a way that excludes some readers perhaps the narrators do not want to include the readers and all of the terms are meant for us to not even look up but just accept\\none of the themes in the novel seems to be selfawareness of hivaids for example after an incident involving christopher who is hiv positive sharing his food with his sister sparks outrage his brotherinlaw dennis becomes very upset and accuses christopher of possibly infecting his sister with hivaids in response to dennis anger christophers partner joe makes his position to dennis and possibly to the reader very clear neither christopher nor i are here to be your hiv or aids education service 109 perhaps alameddine wants the readers to realize that the responsibility of being informed about hivaids is your own although alameddine does not provide anything on the prevention of hivaids the inclusion of hivaids vocabulary allows the reader to be exposed to the reality of the disease alameddines approach is to intrigue readers to learn more about hivaids by not explaining everything to them by planting curiosity within the readers minds they will seek the knowledge\\nanother concept about hivaids throughout the novel is the ignorance of hivaids by american society when the epidemic started out as gayrelated immune deficiency grid in the late 70s early 80s the disease only infected homosexual men as we read further into the book criticisms and notes on hivaids in popular culture become more prevalent there is a certain section of the book almost right in the middle where there is a mock walton scene at first the narrator says i love you to all of these characters who presumably already died then he goes on to talk about a movie called longtime companion that he believes was a joke and could have been called the waltons do aids 114 the movie is said to have been unrealistic and it appears that all the characters sort of died off one by one another movie referenced in this montage is philadelphia film which has a bad reception as well at the end of this scene the narrator says ask the reader they have an objective view of this whole thing okay hey you hey you do you think this is enough 114 the anger within the voice of the character radiates off the page perhaps it is to ask the reader if the pop culture reaction to hivaids has been significant or if it has been ignored due to the constant cultural references in the book when hivaids is presented it is obvious that hivaids was and has been ignored by the majority for a while\\nthis concept is visited again and the message is more obvious when the narrator states when did the last aids story make a newspapers front page my friends die they keep dying but people forget life goes on 152 the statement most likely is a reflection of the portrayal of the disease it is often ignored in the media and because of this ignorance more people believe lies about hivaids and are not familiar with any terms or medication that those with hivaids use\\nalameddine appears to have written koolaids as a reference for readers to learn more about many taboo topics especially hivaids this novel is a good resource for a unique perspective on hivaids and also creates intrigue for the reader to learn more about the topics in the novel\\nthe lebanese civil war\\none of the main components of alameddines novel and one of the few linear components are the diary entries of samirs mother written during the lebanese civil war she gives detailed accounts of her life as a result of the war and how it affects those around her the first diary entry we are given dated march 20 1976 gives an account barely a year after the war began april 1975 we receive a first hand account of how innocent people are injured and killed as a result of the war but we are never really given any background information on the war\\nthe lebanese civil war extended over a 15year period of time from april 1975october 1990 the causes of the war are based on the planned arrangement of political power amongst various ethnic and religious groups stemming from when the country gained its independence from france in 1943 at the time maronite christians were sited as the largest single group however the country also included sunni muslims shia muslims and greek orthodox christians in 1943 once independence was achieved the national pact was formed between the maronites and shia muslims ensuring that those groups will always be in the most powerful political positions the problem was that this type of government known as a confessional democracy left political power in the hands of the same elite families that had power under the french rule by the early 60s the majority of people in lebanon were muslim yet the country was still ruled by the maronite christians\\nduring the late 1950s panarabism became widespread but lebanons maronite president camille chamoun held prowestern views which led to his isolation in the middle east in may 1958 a civil war erupted this in combination with other events occurring simultaneously in the middle east led the united states to send troops to the middle east this threeweek war killed up to 4000 lebanese\\nbut the most important part of this conflict in terms of koolaids stems from the attack of the militia of the christian phalange faction on palestinians in east beirut on april 13 1975 innocent deaths were ubiquitous  as samirs mother states in her first diary entry najwas husband and three sons die just sitting in their apartment during these first few years the lebanese national movement lnm fought for the abolition of the national pact and their partner the plo palestinian liberation organization was expelled from lebanon however this war quickly grew to involve more surrounding countries as leaders in other countries realized the effects this civil war would have on the rest of the middle east both syria and israel supported one of the christian factions but syria quickly changed its allegiance to the national liberal party  a muslim propalestinian group the plo attacked israel and in june 1982 israel bombed lebanon\\nwar continued until the fall of 1989 when remaining members of the lebanese parliament met in saudi arabia to draft the national reconciliation charter commonly known as the taif agreement power was now equally split amongst christians and muslims however another rebellion was launched in 1990 but was suppressed by syria thus ending the 15year civil war\\noverall nearly 200000 lebanese died during these years and although the lebanese government was now reformed it is still based on religious and ethnic quotas\\ngaton dugas\\ngatan dugas during the time in which koolaids takes place was considered to be patient zero of aids he was a flight attendant who was falsely thought to have carried the disease from africa to the western world even though he claimed to have more than 2500 sexual partners there is little support that he was the sole person involved in the spread of aids epidemic he is mentioned near the beginning of this novel where lists of famous and historical figures who were arguably homosexual are written\\nronald reagan\\nronald reagan although not immediately promoted us involvement in the lebanese civil war although he planned to keep troops in lebanon after the beirut barracks bombing that plan was later aborted he kept troops in lebanon for less than a year \\nin addition to criticism for his lack of involvement in the crises in lebanon in koolaids his administration is also criticized for its extraordinarily slow response to the hivaids epidemic that occurred during his presidency in april 1984 the center for disease control announced nearly 2000 deaths in america yet reagan still said nothing by the time he finally addressed the issue in 1987 20849 americans had died from aids \\nmany people still question how much the death toll and research regarding treatments would have changed had he acknowledged the disease when it first arose in america \\ntitle\\nthe title koolaids the art of war is a combination of the fruit drink koolaid and sun tzus book the art of war\\nalameddine directly mentions koolaid within the text of the novel twice it makes its first appearance as one of the narrative blurbs on page 99 he writes\\ndeath when it approaches ought not to take one by surprise it should be part of the full expectancy of life without an everpresent sense of death life is insipid you might as well live on the whites of eggs you might as well drink koolaid\\nthis phrase drinking the koolaid has a particular significance meaning to accept an argument or philosophy completely or blindly the term originated from the jonestown massacre in which 913 peoples temple cultists committed mass suicide by drinking potassium cyanide laced flavor aid a product similar to koolaid\\nthe second use of koolaid is on page 191 following a vignette about marwa in this story while living in france as teenagers mohammads sister asks a teen magazine for a pen pal from the us she receives a letter from sarah miller a girl who tells her all about her life in des moines iowa which marwa finds funny later a highly exaggerated and fictional essay about growing up in wartorn beirut written by marwa and nawal gets published in several newspapers and the girls send it to sarah as a reply sarahs next letter expresses her shock and includes a slice of fruitcake to ease the pain marwa and nawal never reply but sarah continues to send them letters containing more empathy more daily happenings and more gifts to ease the pain which include a no 2 pencil a mickey mouse eraser and a cookie these letters continue to come at least once every six months always with a gift till the present day of the novel when mohammad overhears nawal talking to marwa about sarah on the phone having never heard of sarah before he picks up the letter to find out about sarahs newest deliberations and doings along with her gift to ease their pain which turns out to be a single packet of blue lemonade koolaid\\ngiven that many of the characters in the novel are hiv and are dying from aids the name koolaids linking cool and aids together may also be an attempt at black humor\\nsun tzu and the art of war are also mentioned in koolaids at the end of one of the narrators editorials on military conflicts in the middle east the narrator describes israel and hizballah firing at each other and how each of them seem to be unable to hit anything but civilian targets he concludes on page 97 saying\\nso there you have it a brief history of the middle east version of the art of war who needs poor old sun\\ncover art\\nthere are three versions of koolaids covers available two feature selfportraits of rabih alameddine which come from a series of 270 different paintings based on the same image this image is a closeup of a mans face focusing on the eyes eyebrows nose and mouth the koolaids cover only uses one version of the selfportrait but varies in the font of the title and the shade of the painting for this particular selfportrait the mans features are slightly fuzzily drawn with very thick black lines the rest of the painting the skin of the face is a mottled and faded yellowgreen there are a series of miniature sketches of the main face scaled down underneath the right eye and several sketches of men running diagonally from above the nose to the left cheek these sketches are mostly simple headshots with minimal detail one however contains more than just a head and shoulders he is drawn down to the waist and has more hair than the others\\nthe other cover is a quote from amy tan reviewing the book\\n rabih alameddines koolaids is the companion guide to the tibetan book of the dead the diary of anne frank and the history of the world it is hysterical in both senses hilarious and loudly disturbing where else does krishnamurti meet eleanor roosevelt and tom cruise like zen koans koolaids issues pronouncements while pointing out the absurdities of any kind of truth it contemplates the meaning of death while redefining the meaninglessness of life it looks at the great cycle of history destiny and literature and puts them on spin and recycle this is an absolutely brilliant book  daring in its somersault of literary feats and allusions an antidote for nayone who suffers from the blahs or an excess of selfsatisfaction i hope its widely read\\namy tan\\nthis quote is printed in black text with rabih alameddines name and the second usage of koolaids printed in red there is nothing else on the cover just a white background\\nreception\\nkoolaids the art of war generally received positive critical reviews kirkus reviews called it a wildly uneven but powerful and original portrayal of cultural and sexual displacement alienation andin its admirably gritty waypride\\nthe portland oregonian publishers weekly and writer amy tan all wrote favorably of it as well \\nthe new york times however found it mediocre saying\\nmost readers will wind up wishing alameddine himself had more literary flair despite some interesting ideas and memorable imagery his book demonstrates little feel for narrative in fact there is hardly any dramatic urgency in this collage of observations thoughts and vignettes an accomplished novelist can keep his readers interest in a topsyturvy story but alameddine has a long way to go before he can pull off that trick'}, {'title': 'Fertilisation_of_Orchids', 'label': 'Book', 'text': 'fertilisation of orchids is a book by english naturalist charles darwin published on 15 may 1862 under the full explanatory title on the various contrivances by which british and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects and on the good effects of intercrossing darwins previous book on the origin of species had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised and this new idea was explored in detail field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for darwina relief from the drudgery of writingdeveloped into enjoyable and challenging experiments aided in his work by his family friends and a wide circle of correspondents across britain and worldwide darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids\\nthe book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of orchids and insects the view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation it influenced botanists and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers it opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology directly related to darwins ideas on evolution and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by crossfertilisation although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low it established darwin as a leading botanist orchids was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants\\nthe book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer by showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a creator darwins painstaking observations experiments and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of catasetum which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant in addition they produced testable predictions including his thencontroversial proposal that the long nectary of angraecum sesquipedale meant that there must be a moth with an equally long proboscis this was confirmed in 1903 when xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in madagascar\\nbackground\\ncharles darwin grew up with an interest in natural history and as a student at the university of cambridge he became a pupil and close friend of botany professor john stevens henslow the year he graduated darwin was given a supernumerary position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the second voyage of hms beagle a trip that lasted five years by the time he returned in october 1836 he had doubts about the doctrine that species were fixed and unchanging within months experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species not just varieties and the patterns he saw inspired the inception of his theory of natural selection in 1838 darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports collected in the zoology of the voyage of hms beagle at the same time as writing a series of books on geology the first of which was the structure and distribution of coral reefs his species work was his prime hobby a background to this writing but it evolved into an extensive research programme during the twenty years before he published his theory\\ninsect fertilisation of plants\\ndarwins speculations on the origin of species convinced him that crossfertilisation played an important role in keeping specific forms consistent he rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes often deleterious he thought that natural outbreeding through crossfertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous crossfertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community his ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually selffertilising and so every summer darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the crosspollination of flowers\\nin the summer of 1841 charles and emma darwin moved from the turmoil of london to the countryside to down house a quiet former parsonage in the village of downe he wrote the flowers are here very beautiful darwin followed the recommendation of his friend the leading botanist robert brown and read das entdeckte geheimnis der natur im bau und in der befruchtung der blumen the secret of nature in the form and fertilisation of flowers discovered the little known book published in 1793 by christian konrad sprengel but never translated into english introduced the idea that flowers were created by god to fulfill a teleological purpose insects would act as living brushes to crossfertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship this functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty and were generally selffertilising for darwin the concept of evolution gave new meaning to sprengels research into the mechanisms for crossfertilisation he welcomed its support for his supposition that crossfertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from selffertilisation and by 1845 he had verified many of sprengels observations\\na favourite walk took the darwin family to a spot above the quiet cudham valley teeming with orchids including cephalanthera neottia fly orchids and musk orchids they called this place orchis bank and the whole family became involved in darwins researches darwin observed orchids every summer but in twenty years only on two occasions when he noticed butterflies sucking o pyramidalis and gymnadenia did he see insects visiting flowers\\nin 1854 darwin began to work fulltime on the origin of species he examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia pollen masses had been removed from their flowers indicating that they had been visited by insects he experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether by crossfertilising field crops such as fabaceae they would yield more vigorous offspring and published letters about his inconclusive results in the gardeners chronicle in 1857 and 1858 he next applied sprengels methods to empirical research on orchids despite delays caused by recurring illness he made progress on writing his planned big book on evolution but when alfred russel wallaces letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858 darwin quickly wrote on the origin of species as an abstract of his theory published on 22 november 1859 in this book he gave credence to sprengels ideas on the advantages of intercrossing and noted many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them he introduced his new concept the process of coevolution describing the coadaptation of bumblebees and red clover and speculating how a flower and a bee might slowly become either simultaneously or one after the other modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure this was a theme he developed in his orchid book\\nbotany as recreation\\nafter on the origin of species was published darwin became involved in producing revised editions as well as working on variation of animals and plants under domestication as the first part of his planned big book by the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing and needed something fresh and interesting to study during a family visit to relatives at hartfield he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew he collected it and tried to feed it insects thus beginning a longterm study of insectivorous plants he investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure crosspollination in orchids as an enthusiastic practical scientist such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment he relished pitting his wits against nature and following lucky hunches his theory was a way of looking at the world enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve he later wrote i am like a gambler amp love a wild experiment\\naround the end of april 1860 darwin discussed insect pollination with his friend joseph dalton hooker and mentioned the bee orchid darwin corresponded with hookers assistant daniel oliver the senior curator at kew gardens who became a follower of darwins ideas at the start of june darwin wrote to the gardeners chronicle asking for readers observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised his letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common british orchids and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from orchis morio and orchis mascula plants in the open but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar he wrote to american botanist asa gray that he had been so struck with admiration at the contrivances that i have sent notice to gardeners chronicle and made similar enquiries of other experts\\ndarwin became engrossed in meticulous microscopic examination tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar so that the insects transported pollen to crosspollinate other plants and on 19 july he told hooker i am intensely interested on subject just as at a game of chess in september he dissected with the greatest interest and wrote the contrivances for insect fertilisation in orchids are multiform amp truly wonderful amp beautiful by october he had a large mass of notes with many new facts but set them aside convinced that i ought to work on variation amp not amuse myself with interludes\\nresearch and draft\\nduring 1861 botany became a preoccupation for darwin and his projects became serious scientific pursuits he continued his study of orchids throughout the summer writing to anyone who might be able to supply specimens he had not yet examined field naturalists botanists and country gentry sent specimens from across the british isles darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him his family joined in and neighbours contributed to the research as he had only a cold greenhouse a friend on the other side of the village who had a hothouse allowed him to use that and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens darwins aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of god he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of ad hoc evolutionary adaptations in june he described his examination of bee orchids as a passion and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as beautiful facts\\nthere were several replies to darwins enquiry in the gardeners chronicle seeking evidence to support his idea that pollen masses attached themselves to a convenient place on an insects back or head usually its proboscis to transport the pollen to another flower one envelope appeared to be empty when it arrived at down house but when he looked further before discarding it he found several insect mouthparts with pollen masses attached to help their daughter henrietta convalesce from illness the darwins arranged to spend two months in torquay darwin wrote\\nhe sought advice on obtaining the exotic south american catasetum to see it eject pollen masses as i am got intensely interested on subject amp think i understand pretty well all the british species they went to torquay on 1 july and darwin began writing his orchid paper by 10 august he feared his paper would run to 100 ms folio pages the beauty of the adaptations of parts seems to me unparalleled\\xa0 i marvel often as i think over the diversity amp perfection of the contrivances\\nthe family returned to downe on 27 august and darwin again wrote to the gardeners chronicle appealing for assistance as he was very anxious to examine a few exotic forms his requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens these would be a test of his theory previously aspects such as coloration of plants and animals had often been regarded as having no adaptive function for example thomas henry huxley was strongly influenced by german idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline\\xa0 are any good to the animals\\xa0 who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers\\xa0  darwin had and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case his ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration\\nthe completed orchis paper came to 140 folio pages and darwin decided against presenting it at the linnean society of london thinking of publishing a pamphlet instead he offered the draft to john murray who agreed to publish it as a book although darwin feared a lack of public interest he hoped it would serve to illustrate how natural history may be worked under the belief of the modification of species in discussions with asa gray about natural theology he wrote that it really seems to me incredibly monstrous to look at an orchid as created as we now see it every part reveals modification on modification\\nas a popular and acceptable activity botany had been taken up by many middle class ladies and darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence on the recommendation of john lindley darwin wrote to lady dorothy nevill who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends including hooker\\nlinnean society paper\\nthe orchid book was delayed because of illness but darwin continued to look at it as a hobbyhorse which has given me great pleasure to ride he was particularly astounded by the long spur of the angraecum sesquipedale flowers one of the orchids sent by the distinguished horticulturist james bateman and wrote to hooker good heavens what insect can suck it\\nby november a specimen of the exotic south american catasetum orchid hooker had given to darwin had shown its truly marvellous mechanism by which it shot out a pollinium at any insect touching a part of the flower with sticky gland always foremost this plant had astonished botanists in 1836 when robert hermann schomburgk stated that he had seen one plant growing three distinct flowers which usually grew separately and had wrongly been categorised as three distinct genera namely catasetum tridentatum monachanthus viridis and myanthus barbatus john lindley had remarked that such cases shake to the foundation all our ideas of the stability of genera and species one of darwins correspondents told of delight at growing a beautiful specimen of myanthus barbatus imported from demerara then dismay when the plant flowered the next year as a simple catasetum\\nin view of this interest darwin prepared a paper on catasetum as an extract from his forthcoming book which was read to the linnean society of london on 3 april 1862 darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male female and hermaphrodite forms of a single species but as they differed so much from each other they had been classified as different genera\\npublication\\ndarwin sent the incomplete manuscript to his publisher john murray on 9 february 1862 while he was still working on the last chapter although anxious that the book might not sell he could say with confidence that the ms contains many new amp very curious facts amp conclusions when the book was printed he sent out presentation copies to all the individuals and societies who had helped him with his investigations and to eminent botanists in britain and abroad for review\\non 15 may 1862 the book was published under the full title of on the various contrivances by which british and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects and on the good effects of intercrossing in august darwin was well contented with the sale of 768 copies i shd hope amp expect that the remainder will ultimately be sold but the book sold slowly and less than 2000\\xa0copies of the first edition were printed an expanded edition translated into french was published in paris in 1870 and in 1877 murray brought out a revised and expanded second edition with the shortened title the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects this was also published by d appleton amp company of new york in 1877 and a german translation was published in the same year despite being well praised by botanists only about 6000\\xa0copies of the english editions had been sold by 1900\\ncontent\\ndarwin set out a detailed study of common descent with modifications by expanding on the theme of coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in on the origin of species he examined numerous ways in which orchids vary showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollendispersal mechanisms the intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators insects with different ways to crossfertilise the mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement but the result is demanding to read\\nin the introduction darwin explained his aim of meeting complaints that detailed support for his theory was lacking in on the origin of species he chose orchids for his subject as amongst the most singular and most modified forms in the vegetable kingdom in the hope of inspiring work on other species and felt that the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the creator he gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in fertilising orchids and all who had helped him\\nbritish orchids\\nin the first chapter darwin described the british orchids he had studied giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects the first mechanism described is that of orchis mascula which serves as an introduction to the explanation of other orchidaceae in the upper part of the flower a petal shelters the male organ which has two packages of pollen grains held together by thin elastic threads these pollen masses stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky when an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal the labellum and pushes its head and proboscis into the centre of the flower and down to the nectary it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect as the insect flies off each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the female organ achieving cross fertilisation darwin envisaged\\nthis is followed by descriptions of the differences in the mechanisms of several other orchids in orchis pyramidalis the adhesive balls are combined together into a strap or saddle shape which curls round the thin proboscis of a moth or butterfly to attach to it the pair of pollen masses illustrated in the book by showing a moths head with seven pairs of pollen masses attached to its proboscis\\nwhile the bee orchid showed adaptation for selffertilisation its mechanism also enabled occasional crossfertilisation creating the biological diversity that darwin felt was needed for vigorous survival which could not be provided by selffertilisation as an example of how beautifully everything is contrived darwin described how he had found that in spiranthes flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen at torquay he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers starting at the bottom of the spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers he speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen a bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant and fertilise them by this coordinated process the bee would add to her store of honey while perpetuating the flowers which will yield honey to future generations of bees\\nexotic orchids\\nthe book moves on to the various foreign orchids darwin had received from others his experiments showed that the astonishing length of the 11\\xa0inch 290\\xa0mm long nectary hanging from angraecum sesquipedale flowers implied the need for an as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 1011\\xa0inches 250275\\xa0mm long to pollinate these flowers in madagascar he viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race writing that there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the angrcum and the proboscis of certain moths this wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose\\ndarwin described the most remarkable of all orchids catasetum and showed how in these flowers as throughout nature preexisting structures and capacities had been utilised for new purposes he explained the mechanism in which the pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist at the back of the flower when an insect touched an antenna projecting from the back of the flower this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium sticky disc first at the insect in experiments darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring he vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force i touched the antenn of c callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yards distance from the window and the pollinium hit the pane of glass and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc\\nfinal chapter\\ndarwin noted that the essential nectar secreted to attract insects seemed also in some cases to act as an excretion it is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature as worked out by natural selection that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injuring substances should be utilised for purposes of the highest importance homologies of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on fifteen groups of vessels arranged three within three in alternating order he disparaged the idea that this was an ideal type fixed by the omnipotent creator but attributed it instead to its descent from some monocotyledonous plant which like so many other plants of the same division possessed fifteen organs arranged alternately three within three in five whorls and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modificationeach modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed\\ndescribing the final end state of the whole flower cycle as the production of seed he set out a simple experiment in which he took a ripe seed capsule and arranged the seeds in a line then counted the seeds in onetenth of an inch 25\\xa0mm by multiplication he found that each plant produced enough seeds to plant of ground and the great grandchildren of a single plant could carpet the entire surface of the land throughout the globe if unchecked\\nin conclusion he felt that the book had shown that orchids exhibit an almost endless diversity of beautiful adaptations when this or that part has been spoken of as contrived for some special purpose it must not be supposed that it was originally always formed for this sole purpose the regular course of events seems to be that a part which originally served for one purpose by slow changes becomes adapted for widely different purposes\\nhe was almost exasperated by the inventiveness of forms in nature in my examination of orchids hardly any fact has so much struck me as the endless diversity of structurethe prodigality of resourcesfor gaining the very same end namely the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another his focus on detail was justified as the use of each trifling detail of structure is far from a barren search to those who believe in natural selection the contrivances and beautiful adaptations slowly acquired through slight variations subjected to natural selection under the complex and evervarying conditions of life far transcended the most fertile imagination the mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of crossfertilisation for may we not further infer as probable in accordance with the belief of the vast majority of the breeders of our domestic productions that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injuriousthat some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations\\nreception\\nbotanists responded favourably to the book immediately on its publication hooker told darwin that the book showed him to be out of sight the best physiological observer amp experimenter that botany ever saw and was glad to note that two leading traditional botanists had accepted the concept of evolution bentham amp oliver are quite struck up in a heap with your book amp delighted beyond expression daniel oliver thought it very extraordinary and even darwins old beetlehunting rival charles babington by then professor of botany at the university of cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection called it exceedingly interesting and valuable\\xa0 highly satisfactory in all respects the results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so george bentham praised its value in opening a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of nature\\xa0 a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world\\nthe books success in botanical circles was enhanced following benthams public endorsement in his presidential address to the linnean society on 24 may 1862 bentham praised the book as exemplifying the biological method and said that it had nearly overcome his opposition to the origin in his address in 1863 he stated that mr darwin has shown how changes may take place and described it as an unimpeachable example of a legitimate hypothesis in compliance with john stuart mills scientific method this endorsement favourably influenced miles joseph berkeley charles victor naudin alphonse pyramus de candolle jean louis quatrefages and charles daubeny\\nin june 1862 darwin welcomed favourable reviews in the press and wrote to hooker well my orchisbook is a success but i do not know whether it sells after cursing my folly in writing it he told his publisher the botanists praise my orchidbook to the skies and to asa gray he said i am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists darwins geologist friend charles lyell gave it enthusiastic praise next to the origin as the most valuable of all darwins works however the book attracted little attention from the general public and in september darwin told his cousin fox hardly any one not a botanist except yourself as far as i know has cared for it the book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen there were some reviews in gardening magazines but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book and hardly any learned appraisals appeared\\ntheological responses\\nalthough the book contradicted the prevailing natural theology and its teleological approach to design in nature the saturday review thought that it would avoid the angry polemics aroused by on the origin of species the literary churchman welcomed mr darwins expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids only complaining that it was too indirect a way of saying o lord how manifold are thy works psalm 10424 darwin regarded these theological views as irritating misunderstandings but wrote to asa gray describing his approach as a flank movement on the enemy by showing that the wonderful contrivances of the orchid have discoverable evolutionary histories darwin was countering claims by natural theologians that the organisms were examples of the perfect work of the creator\\nthere was considerable controversy surrounding darwins prediction that a moth would be found in madagascar with a long proboscis matching the nectary of angraecum sesquipedale an anonymous article in the edinburgh review of october 1862 by george campbell 8th duke of argyll argued that darwins wording implied purpose and concluded that we know too that these purposes and ideas are not our own but the ideas and purposes of another he considered darwins explanations the most unsatisfactory conjectures and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism emma darwin thought that although argyll was quite opposed to darwins views he praises the orchids in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn darwin was delighted to find that a well written article smashing argylls review was by one of darwins own nephews\\nargyll went on in his 1867 book the reign of law to cleverly ridicule darwins ideas particularly the prediction of a moth in madagascar with a proboscis 1011\\xa0inches 250275\\xa0mm long he believed that adaptations showed divine purpose not a mindless evolutionary arms race in his response creation by law later that year alfred russel wallace produced a detailed explanation of how the nectary could have evolved through natural selection and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the british museum finding that the proboscis of macrosila cluentius from south america was 9\\xa0inches 235\\xa0mm long and the proboscis of macrosila morganii from tropical africa since renamed xanthopan morganii was 7\\xa0inches 190\\xa0mm long an enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by darwins friend hermann mller who stated that his brother fritz mller had caught a sphinx moth in brazil with a proboscis nearly long darwins anticipation was fully met in 1903 when a subspecies of xanthopan morganii was found in madagascar with a proboscis about 12\\xa0inches 300\\xa0mm long and was named xanthopan morganii praedicta to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by darwin on the basis of his theory of natural selection\\ninfluence\\nmichael ghiselin has expressed the view that all studies of coevolution follow directly or indirectly from darwins orchid book which was also the origin of all work on the evolution of extreme specialisation its publication led almost immediately to research by many other naturalists into specialisation and coevolution in some cases analysing other taxa in his autobiography darwin modestly recalled how this work had revived interest in christian konrad sprengels neglected ideas\\namong the many prominent biologists who began research on coevolution hermann mller was particularly interested in the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other like darwin he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure crossfertilisation and added his own premise that most insects were not limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers on this basis he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects without making access too easy for nonpollinators and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar he found that alpine flowers tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes and by butterflies at higher altitudes beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators by comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees he was the first to use a combination of morphological and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation his brother fritz mller used similar methods when studying mimicry in brazil the early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry henry walter bates had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the linnean society of london in december 1861 in darwins presence and published in november 1862\\nothers basing their studies of reproductive ecology on darwins evolutionary approach included friedrich hildebrand and severin axell in europe asa gray and charles robertson in north america in italy federigo delpino adopted the theory of descent but like sprengel had a teleological approach and explained the mechanisms of flowers by the intervention of a psychovitalistic intelligence delpino classified flowers on the basis of the pollinators they attracted and coined many of the terms still in use such as pollination syndrome and ornithophily there was an enormous increase in knowledge during this period in 1874 asa gray paid tribute to darwins work on orchids for explaining all these and other extraordinary structures as well as of the arrangement of blossoms in general and even the very meaning and need of sexual propagation he credited darwin with establishing the understanding that nature abhors close fertilization\\nby the end of the 19th century there were so many uncritical and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited in the 1920s it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects senses led by researchers frederic clements karl von frisch and others their experiments resulted in new information including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision and findings involving bee learning and communication modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies\\nfurther research by darwin\\ndarwin had found the study of orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower are coadapted for fertilisation by insects amp therefore the result of n selectioneven most trifling details of structure his own interest in orchids and in fertilisation of plants by insects continued darwin had been given the use of a hothouse at the rookery on the other side of the village and at the end of 1862 he was persuaded by this neighbours helpful gardener to have his own built at down house as an extension to the existing cold leanto greenhouse the gardener drew up plans and darwin investigated stoves and ventilation devices when it was completed in february 1863 he asked hooker for some plants from kew gardens writing i long to stock it just like a schoolboy and sent his butler with a cart when over 160 different plants were delivered darwin made apologetic remarks about depleting the national collection he told hooker you cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me\\xa0 henrietta amp i go amp gloat over them darwins life was changed by having a warm hothouse to spend time in before his walk round the sandwalk and in the 1870s he had several more hothouses built the children later remembered this routine and the gardeners attending to darwins experimental plants as well as the way that darwin used simple equipment for his experiments dissecting and measuring plants and seeds\\na chance observation thoroughly aroused darwins attention to a surprising decrease in vigour of the offspring of linaria vulgaris following only one instance of selffertilisation and after eleven years of experimental work he published the effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom in 1876 as a complement to the fertilisation of orchids because it shows how important are the results of crossfertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms described in that book he told a friend i cannot endure doing nothing and resumed his work on orchids assisted in his research by his son francis darwin he corresponded about orchids with fritz mller and almost completely rewrote the book with a considerable amount of new material much of which was contributed by mller the revised edition was published in 1877\\nfrancis darwin described it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of fertilisation of orchids not the applause which followed it he quoted one of his fathers last letters about orchids written in 1880\\ncommemoration of darwins work on orchids\\nkent wildlife trust manages downe bank which is near down house and was a favourite place of the darwin family who called it orchis bank because of the many wild orchids which grew there it is now part of the downe bank and high elms site of special scientific interest darwins observations of local orchids and their insect pollinators gave him the evidence for coevolution which provided the basis for the fertilisation of orchids experts have identified orchis bank as the speciesrich setting encapsulated in the closing paragraph of on the origin of species in which darwin wrote\\ndarwins home and its surroundings including specifically orchis bank have been called his landscape laboratory and together were nominated in january 2009 for designation as a world heritage site the bid was made by a

catherine morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman although a tomboy in her childhood by the age of 17 she is in training for a heroine and is excessively fond of reading gothic novels among which ann radcliffes mysteries of udolpho is a favourite\\ncatherine is invited by the allens her wealthier neighbours in fullerton to accompany them to visit the city of bath and partake in the winter season of balls theatre and other social delights soon she is introduced to a clever young gentleman henry tilney with whom she dances and converses through mrs allens old schoolfriend mrs thorpe she meets her daughter isabella a vivacious and flirtatious young woman and the two quickly become friends mrs thorpes son john is also a friend of catherines older brother james at oxford where they are both students\\nthe thorpes are not happy about catherines friendship with the tilneys as they correctly perceive henry as a rival for catherines affections though catherine is not at all interested in the crude john thorpe catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the thorpes and the tilneys though john thorpe continuously tries to sabotage her relationship with the tilneys this leads to several misunderstandings which put catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the tilneys\\nisabella and james become engaged james father approves of the match and offers his son a country parsons living of a modest sum 400 annually but they must wait until he can obtain the benefice in two and a half years isabella is dissatisfied but to catherine she misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay and not by the value of the sum isabella immediately begins to flirt with captain tilney henrys older brother innocent catherine cannot understand her friends behaviour but henry understands all too well as he knows his brothers character and habits\\nthe tilneys invite catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their home northanger abbey catherine in accordance with her novel reading expects the abbey to be exotic and frightening henry teases her about this as it turns out that northanger abbey is pleasant and decidedly not gothic however the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters catherine learns that they were the apartments of mrs tilney who died nine years earlier as general tilney no longer appears to be illaffected by her death catherine decides that he may have murdered her or even imprisoned her in her chamber\\ncatherine discovers that her overactive imagination has led her astray as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments unfortunately henry questions her he surmises and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death she leaves crying fearing that she has lost henrys regard entirely realising how foolish she has been catherine comes to believe that though novels may be delightful their content does not relate to everyday life henry does not mention this incident to her again\\njames writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to isabella and that she has become engaged instead to captain tilney henry and eleanor tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually become engaged to isabella thorpe catherine is terribly disappointed realising what a dishonest person isabella is a subsequent letter from isabella herself confirms the tilney siblings doubts and shows that frederick tilney was merely flirting with isabella the general goes off to london and the atmosphere at northanger abbey immediately becomes lighter and pleasanter for his absence catherine passes several enjoyable days with henry and eleanor until in henrys absence the general returns abruptly in a temper he forces catherine to go home early the next morning in a shocking inhospitable and unsafe move that forces catherine to undertake the journey alone\\nat home catherine is listless and unhappy henry pays a sudden unexpected visit and explains what happened general tilney on the misinformation of john thorpe had believed her to be exceedingly rich as the allens prospective heiress and therefore a proper match for henry in london general tilney ran into thorpe again who angry and petty at catherines refusal of his halfmade proposal of marriage said instead that she was nearly destitute enraged general tilney again on the misinformation of john thorpe returned home to evict catherine when henry returned to northanger his father informed him of what had occurred and forbade him to think of catherine again when henry learns how she had been treated he breaks with his father and tells catherine he still wants to marry her despite his fathers disapproval catherine is delighted though when henry seeks her parents approval they tell the young couple that final approval will only happen when general tilney consents\\neventually general tilney acquiesces because eleanor has become engaged to a wealthy and titled man and he discovers that the morlands while not extremely rich are far from destitute\\ncharacters\\ncatherine morland the naive 17yearold protagonist of the novel catherine lacks life experience but is determined to see the best in people her appearance is pleasing and when in good looks pretty her fondness for gothic novels and an active imagination can skew her interpretation of real events she has a sweet and goodnatured personality and is observant but nave not seeing malicious underlying intentions in peoples actions until the end of the novel she shares with henry tilney her love of sarcastic humour the novel follows catherine as she grows and matures into a better understanding of peoples natures after being exposed to the outside world in bath\\njames morland catherines older brother studying at oxford university makes a surprise visit to bath to see his sister and parents he is humble sweet and funloving like his sister but he is not a very good judge of character and he is both nave and innocent when it comes to matters of the heart\\nhenry tilney a quirky 26yearold wellread clergyman brother of eleanor and frederick tilney and a member of the wealthy tilney family he is catherines love interest and comes to return her feelings in the course of the novel and marries her in the end he is sarcastic intuitive fairly handsome and clever in nature he differs from catherine in being attuned to the behaviour and underlying intentions of others and finds amusement in the folly of those around him\\njohn thorpe brother of isabella thorpe john is an arrogant and boastful young man a terrible conversationalist as he talks of nothing but of his horses and carriages he is loud dimwitted overbearing vengeful and rude even to his own mother john initially takes interest in catherine and grows increasingly possessive of her but when he discovers that it is henry tilney whom she loves he finds ways to manipulate the situation to suit his liking \\nisabella thorpe sister of john thorpe isabella is a beautiful and charming 21yearold woman who can be conniving and manipulative when it suits her purpose she visits bath in search of a wealthy husband she befriends catherine at bath and when she learns about her family fortune takes an interest in catherines brother james morland and eventually succeeds in getting a marriage offer which she accepts but she later breaks off this engagement when she discovers that james will only receive a small portion of his inheritance and is forced to wait two years before marrying\\ngeneral tilney a stern and retired general he is the despotic father of his three children captain tilney frederick henry and eleanor rigid overbearing tyrannical and materialistic in nature general tilney spends most of his time taking care of his estate at northanger abbey strict on punctuality and determined to keep a tight ship within his household general tilney is by nature inflexible and has absolute distaste for anyone or anything that disrupts his schedule or breaks his sense of order some may speculate as to whether or not his difficult personality is due to his losing his wife years earlier the wife died when eleanor was a child and being burdened with raising his children alone however what is certain is that he is rude not only towards his children but also in his poor treatment of catherine throughout the novel general tilney keeps his focus on the advancement and social acceptance of his family making this his top priority even in terms of marriage essentially general tilney is so concerned with his familys name and fortune that he tries to control who his children can and cannot marry especially with regard to henrys love for catherine due to the misguided rumours from john thorpe general tilneys perception of catherine changes in that he once held her in high esteem thinking that she came from a wealthy family however when a spurned john thorpe later tells general tilney that catherines family is essentially destitute he denies henrys marriage proposal to catherine eventually after his daughters marriage to a nobleman general tilneys anger subsides and when he discovers the truth in that catherine does in fact descend from a modestly welloff family he finally consents to henry and catherines marriage upon further analysis general tilneys behaviour and attitude brings our attention to the social concerns that were common during jane austens time period\\neleanor tilney she is the younger sister of frederick and henry tilney and the daughter of the tyrannical general tilney making her visit to the city of bath at a later time her friendship with catherine morland begins midway through the novel however despite this delay she is sweet kind and humble like her brother henry and proves herself to be a much more loyal friend to catherine than isabella ever was unfortunately her role in bath is not as significant as she spends the majority of her time acting as a chaperone for catherine and henry but things take a turn for the better when they all make their journey back to northanger abbey because of catherine and eleanors friendship and due to henrys love interest catherine is invited to stay with them in northanger abbey to which they use this opportunity to get to know each other better on a personal level this is the point where eleanor explains the reason for her mothers absence to which we discover that mrs tilney had died due to a serious illness leaving mr tilney with three children to raise by himself other than her friendship with catherine and their time spent together in northanger abbey eleanor plays no other role throughout the novel except for the fact that she persuades her father to grant catherine and henry permission to marry\\nfrederick tilney he is the older brother of henry tilney and eleanor tilney and the presumed heir to the northanger estate frederick is an officer in the army who takes advantage of women with his handsome and fashionable looks pursuing flirtations with pretty girls who are willing to offer him some encouragement though without any serious intent on his part this is evident throughout his interactions with isabella thorpe as mentioned by henry when describing his brothers personality to catherine when he states that frederick is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man he frederick has had about a weeks acquaintance with your friend isabella and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her 1926 however frederick takes his interactions with isabella a step further and manages to sabotage her engagement with catherines brother james morland known as the captain frederick represents societys dual standards for behavior for men and women both he also adds to the mystique of the tilney family like father like son fredericks actions make henry and eleanor more sympathetic characters and his ruining of isabella does the same for her character essentially many readers perceive frederick as nothing but selfish greedy and conniving\\nmr allen although his role is minimal in the story he is a gruff but kind man who is tolerant of mrs allens dimwitted behaviorltref namemr allencharacter analysisgtltrefgt he allows catherine and his wife to accompany him in bath where he is being treated for gout he often takes on a paternal role serving as a guardian figure to catherine especially when he takes an interest in her love affair with henry tilney being noted as taken pains to know who her partner was after their first meeting mr allen approves of the pair as tilneys reputation impresses him\\nmrs allen a very dimwitted childless woman mrs allen is a neighbor of the morlandsltref namemrs allencharacter analysisgtltrefgt who invites catherine to accompany her and her husband to bath for a holiday she thinks about nothing but clothing and how much it costs and remembers very little from most conversations merely repeating things that those around her say back to them supposed to serve as a guardian to catherine during the trip to bath mrs allen is too incapable of independent thought to properly guide catherine through social situations she runs into mrs thorpe a woman she knew fifteen years before at boarding school which leads to her and catherine spending much of their time in bath with the thorpes\\ncomposition\\naccording to notes written by austens sister cassandra after janes death in 1817 the novel was finished by 1798 or 1799 the close resemblance in style to austens juvenilia of the early 1790s together with several injokes that only the austen family could have appreciated strongly suggests that the book was begun during that period probably about 1794 however the references to several gothic novels published after 1794 would indicate austen did not finish the book until about 1798 or 1799 as cassandra austen remembered the scholar cecil emden argued that differences between the catherine portrayed in the bath section of the novel vs the catherine at northanger abbey were due to austen finishing the book at a different stage of her life than when she started\\nmajor themes\\nas in all of austens novels the subjects of society status behavior and morality are addressed northanger abbey however being chronologically the first novel completed by austen though revised later in her life and notably considered a point of departure from her other work as a result of the boldness with which it flaunts its    deceptive air of simplicity with broad bold humour\\nlove marriage and high society\\nwhen catherine enters bath she is rather unaware of the societal setting she will encounter the text notes that her mother also knew little of high society which explains why austen pairs catherine with the allens who are higher ranked in society than she due to their wealth society greatly influences partner selection especially in northanger abbey as general tilney for example disapproves of henry and catherines love due to their disparity in wealth general tilney only accepts henry and catherines marriage after eleanor tilney becomes engaged to a wealthy man further catherine distances herself from john thorpe though he is societally deemed a good match for her rather catherine bravely situates love and companionship as more worthy than standing and rank unlike isabella who ends the novel with two broken engagements\\nlife lived as in a gothic novel\\nthough austen greatly encourages the reading of novels to her readers catherine must learn to separate life from fiction and rein in her very active imagination when catherine accuses general tilney of murdering or locking up his wife she is humiliated when it is discovered to be untrue as henry chastises her by saying you had formed a surmise of such horror as i have hardly words to dear miss morland consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained what have you been judging from upon this catherine is mortified and distraught at the notion that henry would think less of her for her wild assumptions when reflecting catherine identifies that she must separate gothic novels from her judgement of everyday life this serves as a major progression in the novel as it is a sign of catherines maturation and ability to appreciate novels without immediately applying them to her behaviour and thoughts\\nbildungsroman\\nwhile catherine controls her imagination she simultaneously endures the reality of individuals not behaving in the manner they should most prominently catherine realizes she is not to rely upon others such as isabella who are negatively influential on her but to be singleminded and independent isabella regardless of her engagement to james morland flirts with frederick tilney breaks her engagement to james is discarded by frederick and causes herself great shame catherine began to realize the wrongs of isabellas influence when the thorpes cause her to miss her appointment with henry and eleanor tilney early on but it is not until the shocking wrongdoing against her brother that catherine entirely separates herself from their friendship stating that she may never speak to isabella again and is not as upset as she thought she would be as this scene takes place almost immediately after catherines lesson about gothic novels it is a clear sign of her increasing maturity\\nthe value of reading\\nin one of austens narrators boldest proclamations the narrator of northanger abbey exclaims upon the significance of reading novels writing i will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novelwriters of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances to the number of which they are themselves addingjoining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine who if she accidentally take up a novel is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust alas if the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another from whom can she expect protection and regard i cannot approve of it in this famous moment austens narrator acknowledges the hypocrisy in insulting those who read novels it is also made clear in this text that those who are considered good and welleducated read novels such as henry and eleanor tilney john thorpe for example who does not read novels is the cad of the text furthermore there is a distinction made between catherines imagination and childishness that encourages her fantasy of a murderous general tilney rather than it being a direct fault of the novel genre\\nthe importance of time\\nvarious scholars such as the french historian michel foucault and the british marxist ep thompson have argued the 18th century become the era of the clock as availability of massproduced clocks and watches allowed time to be measured more accurately leading to an increased emphasis on doing things on time that not existed before marking the beginning of time discipline as thompson called it in what is seen as example of the new era of time discipline austen frequently used clocks as symbol of general tilneys authority over northanger abbey throughout the novel general tilney is checking his watch and is most insistent that servants and his own family observe the clocks to see if they are doing things on time during her time in bath catherine had easygoing attitude to time having no strict schedule and planning nothing in advance\\nit is only catherine meets henry tilney that the novel begins to speak of the importance of time with catherine having to check the clocks to see if she will be on time to meet him however after arriving at northanger abbey catherine discovers that general tilney is constantly checking his watch and that everything at the abbey happens on a strict schedule which is a marked difference from catherines lax attitude that she displayed in bath when catherine is late to a dinner general tilney shows his displeasure by pacing back and forth in the dining room while frequently glancing at the clock because of the importance of staying on schedule even when general tilney is not around clocks serve as a symbol of his power as catherine finds herself checking what time it is all the time\\nas the novel progresses catherine finds the discipline imposed by the clocks more and more oppressive as she finds that she is living her life according to general tilneys dictates and demands catherine compares general tilney to a clock as something inhuman and mechanical that operates with no regard to the human body at one point when catherine receives a letter from her brother she allows herself half a hours free indulgence of grief and reflection before composing herself for dinner all the while watching the clock when catherine visits the kitchen she notes that it is equipped with all manner of modern cooking equipment and that the cooks worked in an efficient manner like soldiers performing a drill which reflects the generals wish to have everything ordered likewise general tilneys ownership of a glasshouse that allows rare tropical fruit like pineapples to be grown in england was a sign that he was extremely rich as only those in the highest income brackets could afford a glasshouse which was a symbol of luxury in regency england\\npublication\\nausten initially sold the novel then titled susan for 10 to a london bookseller crosby amp co in 1803 this publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them but crosby amp co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text in the spring of 1816 the bookseller sold it back to the novelists brother henry austen for the same sum as they had paid for it there is evidence that austen further revised the novel in 18161817 with the intention of having it published she rewrote sections renaming the main character catherine and using that as her working title\\nafter her death austens brother henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication of northanger abbey in late december 1817 1818 given on the title page as the first two volumes of a fourvolume set with a preface for the first time publicly identifying jane austen as the author of all her novels neither northanger abbey nor persuasion was published under the working title jane austen used aside from first being published together the two novels are not connected later editions were published separately\\nreputation\\nnorthanger abbey and persuasion published together posthumously in december 1817 were reviewed in the british critic in march 1818 and in the edinburgh review and literary miscellany in may 1818 the reviewer for the british critic felt that austens exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination the reviewer for the edinburgh review disagreed praising austen for her exhaustless invention and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots \\nausten scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novelsfor example they misunderstood her use of irony reviewers for example reduced sense and sensibility and pride and prejudice to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice\\nsatire\\ngothic novel etc\\nnorthanger abbey is fundamentally a parody of gothic fiction which was especially popular during the 1790s and at the turn of the nineteenth century austen upends the conventions of eighteenthcentury novels by making her heroine a plain and undistinguished girl from a middleclass family allowing the heroine to fall in love with the hero before he has a serious thought of her and exposing the heroines romantic fears and curiosities as groundless however the british critic robert irvine wrote that though catherines specific fears that general tilney murdered his wife are false the book ends with her general fears of him being confirmed as his character is indeed vicious as the book says catherine at any rate heard enough to feel that in suspecting general tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife she had scarcely sinned against his character or magnified his cruelty likewise the scholar rachel brownstein observed that catherines fears of general tilney are in substance correct though the book notes he turns out be a villain of common life not that of romance brownstein wrote that the conclusion the book invites is our heroines instincts were good guides to truthperhaps even that they were good because they were informed by gothic novels about vulnerable women persecuted by powerful men\\nirvine also points out that though parts of the book do satirize the gothic novels popular in the 18th century the interpretation of the novel as completely a satire of the gothic genre is problematic irvine points out that except in book ii the problems faced by catherine are not caused by her reading gothic novels nor is catherines rejection of romantic love following henrys outburst the climax but instead is followed by catherine being summarily expelled from northanger abbey after general tilney discovers that she is not rich as he had been led to believe irvine observed that for catherine her expulsion is a traumatic event that is equal in its emotional impact to the horrors that she had imagined general tilney committing irvine also notes that the first chapters in the novel satirize the novels of maria edgeworth and frances burney whom the novel ostensibly praises as it does the gothic novels an early sign that henry tilney is the hero while john thorpe is not can be seen in the fact that the former likes to read books while the latter does not\\nausten was also influenced by the female quixote or the adventures of arabella 1752 a novel by charlotte lennox that was an imitation and parody of miguel de cervantes don quixote it was approved by both henry fielding and samuel richardson and applauded by samuel johnson \\nthe story begins with the narrator remarking that the heroine is not really a heroine with the narrator saying catherine was not especially clever nor a great beauty and good without being virtuous the narrator goes to say the reader was expecting the heroine to be very virtuous clever and striking beautiful which makes catherine a strange unaccountable character only with the second chapter does the narrator have anything positive to say about catherine which are even then still qualified by attaching the adjectives remarkable and extraordinary which is only meant ironically as what the narrator calls the extraordinary traits of catherine are in fact quite ordinary which seems to be austens way of satirizing how women were portrayed in contemporary literature austens point appears to be what there is a gulf between how women really are and how they are portrayed in novels the point is further emphasized by satirizing richardsons rule laid out in the rambler that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentlemans love is declared which catherine breaks without suffering later when catherine is feeling depressed her mother tries unsuccessfully to cheer her up by having her read the mirror a popular journal in the late 18th century which seems to be austens way of saying that what the moralising journals have to say is not applicable in real life\\na reviewer in 2016 said austens northanger abbey was in part a playful response to what she considered unnatural in the novels of her day instead of perfect heroes heroines and villains she offers flawed rounded characters who behave naturally and not just according to the demands of the plot\\nmasculine power johnson richardson blair and addison\\nat one point when catherine uses the word nice in a way that henry disapproves of she is warned the word nicest as you use it did not suit him and you had better change it as soon as you can or you shall be overpowered with johnson and blair all the rest of the way the popular 18thcentury arbiters of style and taste such as johnson richardson blair and addison are presented as a canon of masculine power which the novel is competition with at least as much as the gothic novels that were so popular with young women at the time irvine wrote that the way in which henry frequently quotes these authors show he is just as much trapped in the world of the essays laying out rules of conduct and style as catherine is influenced by the gothic novels she loves to read when henry tries to dissuade catherine of her gothicinspired notions that general tilney is a murderer he cites the male authors of the essays that were so influential in establishing rules of proper conduct in short is trying to dismiss one genre that was popular with women with another genre that was popular with men irvine wrote that the fact that the gothic and perhaps the novel in general provides a means whereby young women can think for themselves is perhaps the real threat that henry is countering here after all as we have seen catherines fantasy proves to be a way of imagining as evil a truth about the general that henry never criticises the absolute nature of patriarchal power the type of language that henry uses does not originate with him it is borrowed from the essays of johnson blair and company and gets its authority its power over catherine from that masculine source irvine contended that the discourse of the essays was a linguistic version of the patriarchal power of the general as a way of imposing power over women not by locking them up in a room but imposing a type of language that limits what one may think or not in this sense henry speaks either with his natural tone when he is being himself and his affected tone where he uses the discourse of a johnsonian essay which mirrors the description at the beginning of the book between the narrators ideal heroine and catherine\\nhowever even when henry is speaking with his natural tone his speech is that expected of a polite society in britain at the time the ingenue catherine who has just arrived in bath is unfamiliar with the ways of a polite society and is vaguely aware that henrys affected tone is meant to be satirical but is uncertain about what is the joke here as a bildungsroman catherine has to learn the ways of polite society in order to fit in of her possible guides mrs allen is too dim to provide the necessary knowledge while john thorpe though from the gentry is only interested in gambling and horses with thorpe austen makes the point that mere ownership of land does not make for a gentleman as thorpe is simply too vulgar to be a gentleman despite being of the gentry which is further emphasised that when pays catherine a compliment she says it gives me no pleasure to receive a compliment from someone like him isabella thorpe initially appears as catherines friend but she proves herself an unworthy friend when she mentions to catherines brother james much to the latters mortification that she is too fond of both the tilneys the way in which isabella embarrasses catherine is a violation of the major unwritten rules of polite society namely the reciprocity principle that one should always think of the feelings of others by contrast eleanor just conducts herself as a friend albeit one who speaks in the same sort of language her brother mocks henry establishes himself as worthy of being catherines husband in his role as a lover mentor who teaches catherine the ways of polite society to allow her to eventually fit in\\nas part of the novels satire of the literature of the day the american scholar rachel brownstein noted that henry tilney is described as not quite handsome though very near it it is implied to be not quite entirely manly owing to his love of literature and fabrics and is explicitly shown to be dominated by his father it is general tilney rather than his son who openly admires the attractions of catherines body praising her for the elasticity of her walking which in turn causing her to with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before however brownstein wrote that henry is the hero of the book as he constantly ridicules clich language is able to understand the type of books read by women because he also reads them and is able to rise above the crowd as notes the lazy language used by others who overuse words like amazingly and nice another trope of the fiction of the day is satirized when catherine first meets henry at a dance and likes him right away which in its turn causes him to pay attention to her for the first time most notably it is the thorpes who have to restrain catherine from following henry after the dance by holding her arms which was not the sort of behavior that was expected of heroines in romantic novels at the time\\nfamily entertainment\\naccording to austen biographer claire tomalin there is very little trace of personal allusion in the book although it is written more in the style of a family entertainment than any of the others joan aiken writes we can guess that susan the original title of northanger abbey in its first outline was written very much for family entertainment addressed to a family audience like all jane austens juvenile works with their asides to the reader and absurd dedications some of the juvenilia we know were specifically addressed to her brothers charles and frank all were designed to be circulated and read by a large network of relations\\nallusions to other works\\nseveral gothic novels and authors are mentioned in the book including fanny burney and the monk isabella thorpe gives catherine a list of seven books that are commonly referred to as the northanger horrid novels these works were later thought to be of austens own invention until the british writers montague summers and michael sadleir rediscovered in the 1920s that the novels actually did exist the list is as follows\\nall seven of these were republished by the folio society in london in the 1960s and since 2005 valancourt books has released new editions of the horrids the seventh and final being released in 2015\\nthe mysteries of udolpho\\nthe most significant allusion however is to ann radcliffes the mysteries of udolpho as it is the gothic novel most frequently mentioned within this text notably jane austen sold the manuscript of northanger abbey to the same firm that published radcliffes novel in 1794\\nthis outside text is first mentioned in chapter six when isabella and catherine discuss the mystery behind the black veil and further establish their friendship based on their similar interests in novel genre and their plans to continue reading other gothic novels together austen further satirizes the novel through catherines stay at northanger abbey believing that general tilney has taken the role of gothic novel villain\\naustens discussion of udolpho is also used to clearly separate catherine from john thorpe as when catherine talks about the novel with him he crudely responds that he never reads novels but qualifies his statement by arguing he would only read a novel by ann radcliffe who as catherine then points out is the author of udolpho here austen humorously categorizes northanger abbeys characters into two spheres those who read novels and those who do not when catherine and henry tilney later discuss reading novels and henry earnestly responds that he enjoys reading novels and was especially titillated by udolpho the match between catherine and henry is implied as both smart and fitting\\nallusions to northanger abbey\\na passage from the novel appears as the preface of ian mcewans atonement thus likening the naive mistakes of austens catherine morland to those of his own character briony tallis who is in a similar position both characters have very overactive imaginations which lead to misconceptions that cause distress in the lives of people around them both treat their own lives like those of heroines in fantastical works of fiction with miss morland likening herself to a character in a gothic novel and young briony tallis writing her own melodramatic stories and plays with central characters such as spontaneous arabella based on herself\\nrichard adams quotes a portion of the novels last sentence for the epigraph to chapter 50 in his watership down the reference to the general is felicitous as the villain in watership down is also a general\\njasper fforde in his alternate history comic fantasy novel first among sequels refers to northanger abbey as being under maintenance and should be ready on time as long as catherine stops attempting to have the book gothicized it appears again as the prize in a reality program based on the lives of the bennets from pride and prejudice\\nreference to baseball\\nthe book also contains an early historical reference to baseball it is found in the first chapter of the novel describing the interest of the heroine  catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback and running about the country it is not the earliest known reference to the term which is a 1744 british publication a little pretty pocketbook by john newbery as described in origins of baseball the modern game is not described but the term is used\\nadaptations\\nliterature\\nharpercollins hired scottish crime writer val mcdermid in 2012 to adapt northanger abbey for a modern audience as a suspenseful teen thriller the second rewrite in the austen project mcdermid said of the project at its heart its a teen novel and a satire  thats something which fits really well with contemporary fiction and you can really feel a shiver of fear moving through it i will be keeping the suspense  i know how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat i think jane austen builds suspense well in a couple of places but she squanders it and she gets to the endgame too quickly so i will be working on those things the novel was published in 2014\\nin 2011 marvel published a graphic novel version of northanger abbey adapted by nancy butler writer janet k lee artist and nick filardi color artist the book originally is the last of the jane austen adaptations made by marvel and contrarily to the other books of the series is the only one to be released only in paperback not in hardback\\nthe same year author jenni james published a modern teen version entitled northanger alibi published by inkpress in which the main characters obsession for stephenie meyers twilight saga replaces catherines love for regency gothic novels\\nnewbury acres an amish retelling of

of the spokane indians\\nthe autobiographical nature of the novel reflects the internal struggle for identity that alexie dealt with as a child his personal experiences then tie into the idea of the trauma that native american tribes live with as they still struggle to balance assimilation with identity this phenomenon has been explored and analyzed since the publication of the novel\\njan johnson clinical assistant professor of american indian and african american literatures at the university of idaho utilizes alexies novel to explore the idea of marginalization and oppression in native american communities in her article healing the soul wound johnson identifies the soul wound the deepseated trauma native americans have endured since colonization and continue to struggle with this term explains how the consistent depiction of native american people as suffering and helpless has become ingrained into their identity johnson writes alexie feels thatas a result of this grim historysuffering and trauma are fundamental to the experience of being native american ceaseless suffering attains an epistemological status johnson uses the novel to illustrate her thoughts about the future of the native american culture the spokane indians and tribes like them face the trauma of searching for an identity in a world that attempts to envelop ones culture johnson argues that alexie uses diary to represent the potential for healing the traumas that native american tribes have faced throughout history\\nin sherman alexie a collection of critical essays critics jeff burglund and jan roush interpret jan johnsons definition of the soul wound as intergenerational suffering on pages 10 and 11 of diary alexie elaborates on the concept of generational poverty when he reveals that juniors family is too poor to care for the familys sick dog my parents came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people all the way back to the very first poor people he writes junior is wounded which alexie shows through juniors alcoholic father his misguided sister and his defeating social life through diary alexie aims to make a larger statement about the need for change in both the internal structure and the external perception of native american communities in the united states columbus and his men colonized the new land they encountered in horrid ways that diminished native people of anything they had violent invasions by columbus and his crew left the indians with nothing to call their own sacred land animals plants and relatives were all lost during the time of what maria yellow brave heart and lemyra debruyn called the american indian holocaust the ones that were somewhat fortunate enough to stay alive were brainwashed of everything they knew and were forced to believe and follow the religious practices of the christian faith despite the fact it was not what they believed in the indians were also forced to relocate and leave everything which led to many of them dying due to illness or unbearable conditions they had to walk in some native peoples are still affected by this trauma many argue that historical unresolved grief is the cause of high crime rates and mental health issues among native american people today maria yellow horse brave heart and lemyra debruyn explain the meaning behind historical disenfranchised grief and how it is overlooked by americans american indians are experiencing disenfranchised grief because of how this group of people was and still is seen as savage emotionless and lacking of right or reason to mourn and grieve\\nmulticultural literature\\nthere are many arguments for why the absolutely true diary of a parttime indian is an example of multicultural literature a textbook called sherman alexie in the classroom was recently published in order to help teachers and educators explore how multicultural texts can impact the learning outcome of studentsespecially for native americans in the modern times this text explores the significance and the message behind the works of sherman alexie including poetry novels films strips and much more\\nthe absolutely true diary of a parttime indian is a multicultural text that many english teachers use in order to educate their students about the native american heritage the author alexie himself is of the spokane heritage and as a result he uses his own background and personal experiences to write this specific novel in a semiautobiographical format teachers refer to the textbook sherman alexie in the classroom to claim that the book provides an opportunity to educate nonnative american students to work through their white guilt and develop antiracist perspectives\\nin an interview alexie stated that the primary audience is collegeeducated white women so thats who reads everything if you want to talk about an indication of thatcertainly this book is geared towards young adults but i was at the american library association convention in dc a couple of weeks ago and there were something like 15000 librarians there and 99 percent of them were white women so  thank god  they seem to be the people most willing to ignore barriers and boundaries and to reach across so thats who my audience is in reality in this book specifically im really hoping it reaches a lot of native kids certainly but also poor kids of any variety who feel trapped by circumstance by culture by low expectations im hoping it helps them get out\\nalexie also wants his literature to concern the daily lives of indians he thinks most native american literature is so obsessed with nature that he doesnt think it has any useful purpose alexis was quoted saying theres a kid out there some boy or girl who will be that great writer and hopefully theyll see what i do and get inspired by that\\nfurthermore alexies texts encourage educators to initiate discussions in their classrooms about the native american culture as a whole many stereotypes of native americans exist in the united states therefore many people have erroneous views of what modern native americans lives are like 11th and 12th grade english teacher bryan ripley crandall believes that learning about different cultural backgrounds creates a diverse learning environment crandall also states that the native american narrative of alexies book is a way of giving minority students an access to their own background and heritage within an american education therefore alexies multicultural literature of the absolutely true diary of a parttime indian provides an expanded perspective of the daily lives of native americans living on the reservation in todays world\\nmedia\\naudiobook\\nthe author sherman alexie himself narrates the audiobook of the absolutely

and ann clayborne who stakes out the position that humankind does not have the right to change entire planets at their will\\nrussells view is initially purely scientific but in time comes to blend with the views of hiroko ai the chief of the agricultural team who assembles a new belief system the areophany devoted to the appreciation and furthering of life viriditas these views are collectively known as the green position while claybornes naturalist stance comes to be known as red the actual decision is left to the united nations organization of mars affairs unoma which greenlights terraforming and a series of actions get underway including the drilling of moholes to release subsurface heat thickening of the atmosphere according to a complicated biochemical formula that comes to be known as the russell cocktail after sax russell and the detonation of nuclear explosions deep in the subsurface permafrost to release water additional steps are taken to connect mars more closely with earth including the insertion of an areosynchronous asteroid clarke to which a space elevator cable is tethered\\nagainst the backdrop of this development is another debate one whose principal instigator is arkady bogdanov of the russian contingent possibly named in homage to the russian polymath and science fiction writer alexander bogdanov  it is later revealed in blue mars that alexander bogdanov is an ancestor of arkadys bogdanov argues that mars need not and should not be subject to earth traditions limitations or authority he is to some extent joined in this position by john boone famous as the first man on mars from a preceding expedition and rival to frank chalmers the technical leader of the american contingent their rivalry is further exacerbated by competing romantic interest in maya katarina toitovna the leader of the russian contingent in the opening of the book chalmers instigates a sequence of events that leads to boone being assassinated much of what follows is a retrospective examination of what led to that point\\nearth meanwhile increasingly falls under the control of transnational corporations transnats that come to dominate its governments particularly smaller nations adopted as flags of convenience for extending their influence into martian affairs as unomas power erodes the mars treaty is renegotiated in a move led by frank chalmers the outcome is impressive but proves shortlived as the transnats find ways around it through loopholes things get worse as the nations of earth start to clash over limited resources expanding debt and population growth as well as restrictions on access to a new longevity treatment developed by martian scientistsone that holds the promise of lifespans into the hundreds of years in 2061 with boone dead and exploding immigration threatening the fabric of martian society bogdanov launches a revolution against what many now view as occupying transnat troops operating only loosely under an unoma rubberstamp approval initially successful the revolution proves infeasible on the basis of both a greaterthanexpected willingness of the earth troops to use violence and the extreme vulnerability of life on a planet without a habitable atmosphere a series of exchanges sees the cutting of the space elevator bombardment of several martian cities including the city where bogdanov is himself organizing the rebellion he is killed the destruction of phobos and its military complex and the unleashing of a great flood of torrential groundwater freed by nuclear detonations\\nby the end most of the first hundred are dead and virtually all who remain have fled to a hidden refuge established years earlier by ai and her followers one exception is phyllis boyle who has allied herself with the transnats she is on clarke when the space elevator cable is cut and sent flying out of orbit to a fate unknown by the conclusion of the book the revolution dies and life on mars returns to a sense of stability under heavy transnat control the clash over resources on earth breaks out into a fullblown world war leaving hundreds of millions dead but ceasefire arrangements are reached when the transnats flee to the safety of the developed nations which use their huge militaries to restore order forming policestates but a new generation of humans born on mars holds the promise of change in the meantime the remaining first hundred including russell clayborne toitovna and cherneshevsky settle into life in hiroko ais refuge called zygote hidden under the martian south pole\\ngreen mars\\xa0 terraforming\\ngreen mars takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed plants to grow it picks up the story 50 years after the events of red mars in the dawn of the 22nd century following the lives of the remaining first hundred and their children and grandchildren melting ice causes the top of the dome of hiroko ais base under the south pole to collapse forcing the survivors to escape into a less literal underground organization known as the demimonde among the expanded group are the first hundreds children the nisei a number of whom live in hirokos second secret base gamete\\nas unrest in the multinational control over marss affairs grows various groups start to form with different aims and methods watching these groups evolve from earth the ceo of the praxis corporation sends a representative arthur randolph to organize the resistance movements this culminates into the dorsa brevia agreement in which nearly all the underground factions take part preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s from converting moholes to missiles silos or hidden bases sabotaging orbital mirrors to propelling deimos out of mars gravity well and out into deep space so it could never be used as a weapons platform as phobos was\\nthe book follows the characters across the martian landscape which is explained in detail russells character infiltrates the transnat terraforming project with a carefully crafted fake identity as stephen lindholm the newly evolving martian biosphere is described at great length and with more profound changes mostly aimed at warming up the surface of mars to the brink of making it habitable from continentsized orbital mirrors another space elevator built using another anchored asteroid that is dubbed new clarke to melting the northern polar ice cap and digging moholes deep enough to form volcanoes a mainstay of the novel is a detailed analysis of philosophical political personal economic and geological experiences of the characters the story weaves back and forth from character to character providing a picture of mars as seen by them\\nsax alias stephen eventually becomes romantically involved with phyllis who had survived the events of 2061 from the end of the first novel but she discovers his true identity and has him arrested members of the underground launch a daring rescue from the prison facility where sax suffers torture and interrogation that causes him to have a stroke maya kills phyllis in the process of the rescue\\nthe book ends on a major event which is a sudden catastrophic rise in earths global sea levels not caused primarily by any greenhouse effect but by the eruption of a chain of volcanoes underneath the ice of west antarctica disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean the resultant flooding causes global chaos on earth creating the perfect moment for the martian underground to seize control of martian society from earth following a series of largely bloodless coups an extremist faction of reds bombs a dam near burroughs the major city where the remaining united nations forces have concentrated in order to force the security forces to evacuate the entire city is flooded and the population of the city has to walk a staggeringly long distance in the open martian atmosphere which just barely has the temperature atmospheric pressure and gas mixture to support human life to libya station in order to resettle in other locations with this control of mars is finally wrested away from earth with minimal loss of life leaving the weary survivors hopeful about the prospects of their newfound political autonomy\\nblue mars\\xa0 longterm results\\nblue mars takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed atmospheric pressure and temperature to increase so that liquid water can exist on the planets surface forming rivers and seas it follows closely in time from the end of green mars and has a much wider scope than the previous two books covering an entire century after the second revolution as earth is heavily flooded by the sudden melting of the antarctic ice cap the once mighty metanats are brought to their knees as the praxis corporation paves a new way of democratic businesses mars becomes the head of the system giving universal healthcare free education and an abundance of food however this sparks illegal immigration from earth so to ease the population strain on the blue planet martian scientists and engineers are soon put to the task of creating asteroid cities where small planetoids of the belt are hollowed out given a spin to produce gravity and a minisun is created to produce light and heat\\nwith a vast increase in sciences technologies and spacecraft manufacturing this begins the accelerando where humankind spreads its civilization throughout the solar system and eventually beyond as venus the jovian moons the saturnian moons and eventually triton are colonized and terraformed in some way jackie boone the granddaughter of john boone the first man to walk on mars from the first book takes an interstellar vessel made out of an asteroid to another star system twenty lightyears away where they will start to terraform the planets and moons found there\\nthe remaining first hundred are generally regarded as living legends reports of hirokos survival are numerous and purported sightings occur all over the colonized solar system but none are substantiated nadia and art randolph lead a constitutional congress in which a global system of government is established that leaves most cities and settlements generally autonomous but subject to a central representative legislature and two systems of courts one legal and the other environmental the environmental court is packed with members of the red faction as a concession in exchange for their support in the congress as much of their power was broken when they attempted and failed to violently expel remaining un forces early on after the second revolution of green mars yet they still retained enough power to stymie constitutional negotiations vlad marina and ursula the original inventors of the longevity treatments introduce a new economic system that is a hybrid of capitalism socialism and environmental conservationism during a trip to earth occurring alongside the congress nirgal one of the original children to be born on mars to the first hundred and something of a marswide celebrity maya and sax negotiate an agreement that allows earth to send a number of migrants equal to 10 of mars population to mars every year following the adoption of the new constitution nadia is elected the first president of mars and serves competently although she does not enjoy politics she and art work together closely and eventually fall in love and have a child\\nsax russell devotes himself to various scientific projects all the while continuing to recover from the effects of his stroke since the second revolution he feels enormous guilt that his proterraforming position became the dominant one at the expense of the goals of anns antiterraforming stance as sax and ann have come to be regarded as the original champions of their respective positions sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from ann while ann depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments however when sax witnesses ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world he arranges for her to be resuscitated and to be treated with the longevity treatment both against her will\\nthe longevity treatments themselves begin to show weaknesses once those receiving them reach the twocentury mark in age the treatments reduce most aging processes to a negligible rate but are much less effective when it comes to brain function and in particular memory maya in particular suffers extreme lapses in memory although she remains high functioning most of the time further as people age they begin to show susceptibility to strange fatal conditions which have no apparent explanation and are resistant to any treatment most common is the event that comes to be known as the quick decline where a person of extremely advanced age and in apparently good health suffers a sudden fatal heart arrythmia and dies abruptly the exact mechanism is never explained michel dies of the quick decline while attending the wake of another first hundred member russell speculates that michels quick decline was brought on by the shock of seeing maya fail to remember frank chalmers who was killed while escaping security forces in the first revolution upon looking at a treasured photo of him on her refrigerator as a result of this and russells own problems with memory he organizes a team of scientists to develop medicine that will restore memory the remaining members of the first hundred of which there are only 12 congregate in underhill and take the medicine it works so well that russell remembers his own birth he and ann clayborne finally recall that they had been in love prior to leaving earth the very first time but both had been too socially inept and nervous about their chances for selection for the mars voyage to reveal this to each other their famous argument over terraforming had been a mere continuation of a running conversation they had been having since they still lived on earth through the memory treatment it is also revealed that phyllis had been lobbying to free sax from his torturers when she was murdered by maya maya herself declines the treatment sax also distinctly recalls hiroko assisting him in finding his rover in a storm before he nearly froze to death before disappearing once again and is convinced she remains alive although the question of whether she is actually alive is never resolved\\neventually the antiimmigration factions of the martian government provoke massive illegal immigration from earth risking another war however under the leadership of ann and sax who have fallen in love again following their reconciliation along with maya the martian population unites to reconstitute the government to accept more immigration from earth diffusing the imminent conflict and ushering in a new golden age of harmony and security on mars\\nthe martians\\xa0 short stories\\nthe martians is a collection of short stories that takes place over the timespan of the original trilogy of novels as well as some stories that take place in an alternate version of the novels where the first hundreds mission was one of exploration rather than colonization buried in the stories are several hints about the eventual fate of the martian terraforming program\\nstory elements\\ncorporations\\ntransnational corporations nicknamed transnats are extremely powerful multinational corporations that first emerge in the mid21st century robinson tracks the evolution of the transnats into what he terms metanats metanational these multinational corporations have grown so large as a result of globalization that they have sufficient economic power to take over or strongly manipulate national governments initially only relatively small thirdworld governments but later larger developed governments too effectively running whole countries in robinsons future history the metanational corporations become similar to nationstates in some respects while continually attempting to take over competitors in order to become the sole controller of the interplanetary market as the mars trilogy draws to a close in the mid23rd century the metanational corporations are forced by a global catastrophe to concede more democratic powers to their workforces\\nalthough there are many transnational and metanational corporations mentioned two play an active role in the development of the plotline praxis a largely benevolent and relatively democratic firm and subarash which plays a large role in the maltreatment of the citizens of mars\\ngenetic engineering\\ngenetic engineering is first mentioned in red mars it takes off when sax creates an alga to withstand the harsh martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air eventually this is done on a massive scale with thousands of types of ge algae lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet in green mars ge animals began to be created to withstand the thin martian atmosphere and to produce a working planetarybiosphere by blue mars ge is commonly being done on humans willingly to help them better adapt to the new worlds to breathe thinner air eg russell or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets\\nother themes\\nthe books also speculate on the colonization of other planets and moons in the solar system and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on callisto mercury titania miranda and venus toward the end of the last novel humans are taking sublight colony ships to other stars taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive the trip to their destinations\\na great portion of blue mars is concerned with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated longevity treatments in particular robinson speculates on the psychological effects of ultralongevity including memory loss personality change mental instability and existential boredom\\ncharacters\\nthe first hundred\\nthe initial colonists from the ares who established a permanent colony many of them later become leaders or exemplary figures in the transformation of mars or its new society the first hundred actually consisted of 101 with coyote being smuggled aboard the ares by hiroko\\njohn boone\\nan american astronaut who was the first human to walk on mars in the year 2020 he returns a public hero and uses his considerable influence to lobby for a second mission this time one of colonization boone received a large amount of radiation on his first trip to mars more than the recommended dosage according to medical regulations however his celebrity status allows him to skirt this on the second voyage boone is one of the first hundred colonists sent to permanently colonize mars his accomplishments and natural charm yield him an informal leadership role in the first chapter of red mars john boone is assassinated in a plot instigated by frank chalmers the narrative then steps back to the first hundreds voyage to mars aboard the spaceship ares his ideas continue as a point of reference for the remainder of the trilogy boones character portrayal is complex in one light boone is a stereotypically simple heroic figure an everyman hero his first words on his first trip to mars are well here we are he is almost uniformly cheerful and goodnatured and approaches everything he undertakes with hale bonhomie but later in red mars robinson switches to boones point of view and it is in this section that it is revealed that late in life boone is addicted to omegendorph a fictional drug that is based on endorphins in the human brain in addition it reveals that at least some of his seeming simplicity might simply be an act designed to further his political goals overall boone is presented as largerthanlife\\nfrank chalmers\\nhead of the american contingent he is machiavellian in his use of power however his cynicism is later shown to be a form of selfdefense chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side early in the voyage to mars he becomes sexually involved with maya toitovna the leader of the russian contingent of the mission during the second half of the voyage toitovna becomes involved with boone already bitter that boone became the first to walk on mars instead of him as they were both candidates for the mission and that he was allowed to join the colonization trip despite his manipulations chalmers further despises boone because of toitovnas affection his dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate boone which ultimately succeeds and allows him to take over handling major affairs on mars this ultimately becomes his undoing as his ruthless governance and aggressive diplomatic work backfire on him during the revolution of 2061 in the final chapters of red mars chalmers flees with toitovna and other members of the first hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap but dies along the way when he is caught outside their vehicle during an aquifer flood in valles marineris\\nmaya toitovna\\nan emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between boone and chalmers she begins as head of the russian contingent the novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission after the first revolution she flees with other members of the first hundred to the hidden colony in the pole she becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force after the deaths of chalmers and boone she falls in love with michel duval she suffers heavily from bipolar disorder and from memoryrelated psychological disorders with growing age which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent throughout the novels maya takes an active political role helping to keep the surviving first hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later despite her psychological problems\\nnadezhda nadia chernyshevski\\na russian engineer who started out building nuclear reactors in siberia during the voyage and initial exploration of mars she does her best to avoid the squabbles of the other members of the first hundred instead she busies herself by building the first permanent habitation of mars underhill using programmed automated robots she also helps to construct a new and larger habitat and research facility in a nearby canyon in the later books she becomes a reluctant politician chernyshevski is in love with bogdanov and is devastated when he is killed in an attack by antirevolutionary forces associated with unoma the transnationals and phyllis boyle during the first martian revolution in retaliation for bogdanovs murder she activates his hidden weapon system built into phobos which causes the entire moon a unomatransnational military base to decelerate in orbit and destructively aerobrake in mars atmosphere utterly destroying it in blue mars she falls in love with art randolph with whom she eventually starts a family after martian independence she grudgingly becomes the first president of mars\\narkady bogdanov\\na mechanical engineer with anarchist leanings possibly based on the russian machist alexander bogdanov the characters ancestor and arkady strugatsky he is regarded by many other members of the first hundred particularly boyle as a troublemaker he leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon phobos and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first novel like boone with whom he was good friends his political ideas later known as bogdanovism weigh heavily on characters later in the series in love with nadia chernyshevski he is killed during the first martian revolution in 2061\\nsaxifrage sax russell\\nan american physicist he is a brilliant and creative scientist and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts however he is socially awkward and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people russell is a leader of the green movement the goal of which is to terraform mars during green mars sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces and fellow member of the first hundred phyllis boyle although according to later it is revealed she actually opposed saxs torture he subsequently suffers from expressive aphasia and has to relearn how to speak and becomes less predictable in his actions originally apolitical this event and a growing attachment to mars itself leads russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution after memory issues become apparent in many of the remaining first hundred including sax he begins work on an ambitious project to gather the remaining first hundred and have them try an experimental treatment he helped to develop it is after this that sax realizes his persistent attempts to please ann are actually because he is also secretly in love with ann clayborne who cannot stand him at first but after decades on mars eventually reconciles saxifrage means stonebreaker and is the name for an alpine plant that grows between stones\\nann clayborne\\nan american geologist clayborne is one of the first areologists and maintains a stalwart desire to see mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive clayborne early on debates saxifrage russell over the proper role of humanity on mars and though initially apolitical this stance marks her as the original red while russells handson terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series and even her relationship with fellow first hundred settler simon with whom she has a child is subject to introspective silence in most cases simons death and the estrangement she finds from their son peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate green drive her to further isolation claybornes relationship with russell is shown to be complex the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control during the events of blue mars russell intervenes to save claybornes life later the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them ann undergoes a drastic change towards blue mars due to the emergence of something inside of her that she describes as antiann and something else that she cant quite describe\\nhiroko ai\\na japanese expert on biology agriculture and ecological systems it was ai who smuggled desmond coyote hawkins onto the ares the two were friends and lovers as students in london she is the charismatic leader of the farm team one of the important work groups and cliques among the first hundred she thus becomes the focus of many of the trilogys central themes most importantly she teaches the importance of maintaining a respectful relation with ones planet on mars this is called the areophany in the secret colony zygote which hiroko established the first generation of children of the first hundred the ectogenes are all the product of artificial insemination outside of any human body hiroko uses the ova of the female members of the first hundred as the female genetic material and uses the sperm of the male members of the first hundred to fertilize the ova although hiroko is seldom at the center of the narrative her influence is pervasive she disappears for the final time in green mars her ultimate fate is left unresolved\\nmichel duval\\na french psychologist pivotally involved in early psychological screening of first hundred candidates in antarctica which he describes as being a collection of double blind requirements duval is assigned to accompany the mars mission and is treated as an observer rather than as a member of the team during the early events of red mars his aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others but in time it becomes clear that duval is struggling with his own psychological issues perhaps more than anyone else from the expedition during the first disappearance of the farm team he is invited by hiroko to flee with the farm team and establish zygote the first hidden colony duval desperately wants to return to provence as he remembers it and after visiting as a part of the martian diplomatic mission to earth he becomes even more homesick duval falls in love with maya toitovna and guides her through particularly challenging psychological episodes throughout most of the series dying late in blue mars of heart arrhythmia when maya displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss\\nvladimir vlad taneev\\nnearly sixty when he arrives on mars a russian biological scientist who is the oldest of the first hundred taneev heads medical treatment and most research projects on mars becoming famous as the creator of the gerontological treatment used to regenerate human cellular systems and ushering in a new era of longevity he lives in acheron on the great escarpment in the north of mars before fleeing to the hidden colony after the first revolution but later returns to his research falling victim to quick decline late in the events of blue mars for much of his marscentric life taneev lives in a mnage  trois with ursula and marina the exact nature of which is never resolved\\nphyllis boyle\\na christian american geologist with a harsh personality that does not win her many friends among the first hundred and gains particular enmity from ann clayborne as the mars situation develops boyle sides against most of the first hundred in favor of the increasingly authoritarian united nations office of mars affairs unoma and its successor the corporatequasifascist united nations transitional authority unta her influence is strongest during the later events of red mars where by the 2061 revolution she has been placed in charge of the asteroid clarke that serves as the counterweight of the first space elevator the events of the revolution send clarke and boyle spinning off into the outer solar system at the end of red mars green mars finds her back in the equation but her influence is greatly reduced against the backdrop of a muchexpanded unta presence boyle engages in a brief sexual relationship with saxifrage russell who despises her while the latter is living under an assumed identity and is singularly capable of discerning who he really is turning him over the unta she is later present at a session in kasei vallis where russell is being tortured and is killed by maya toitovna later as his memory recovers russell reveals that boyle had been opposed to his torture and was demanding that he be released at the time that mayas team freed him\\ndesmond coyote hawkins\\na trinidadian stowaway he is a friend and supporter of hiroko and a fervent anarchist communist present in red mars only as a stowaway who eventually blends effortlessly into the martian background he is not even identified as anything more than coyote until the beginning of green mars he becomes a leading figure in the underground and an unofficial coordinator of a developing gift economy\\ntheir descendants\\nsince the trilogy covers over 200 years of human history later immigrants and the children and grandchildren of the first hundred eventually become important characters in their own right\\nthe martians use the same

dionisio\\nstyle\\nnarration\\ninstead of daz directly telling the story to the reader he creates an aesthetic distance by speaking through the novels narrator yunior yunior provides analysis and commentary for the events he is relaying in the novel his speech often exemplifies code switching switching rapidly from a lively caribbeaninflected vernacular replete with frequent usage of profanity to wordy eloquent and academic prose this runs in parallel to several central themes of the novel regarding identity as yuniors code switching alludes to a struggle between his dominican identity and his identity as a writer code switching between spanish and english is also central to the narrative itself of the book as characters switch back and forth as they see fit\\nthe narration of the book also shifts away from yunior to another character at several key moments in the story in chapter two lola narrates her own story from the first person this is foreshadowing of the intimacy between lola and yunior yet to come the beginning of chapter two also features the use of second person narration rarely used in literature\\ndazs use of yunior as the main narrator of the book strengthens the idea of the novel as metafiction yunior reminds the reader consistently that he is telling the story as opposed to the story happening in its own right\\nfootnotes\\nthe brief wondrous life of oscar wao makes extensive use of footnotes to the point that many of the characters are developed in the footnotes in addition to the story rather than just provide factual background yuniors narrative continues in the footnotes just as it does in the body of the novel when describing oscars deep love of science fiction and fantasy literature yunior continues in the footnotes where this outsized love of genre jumped off from no one quite seems to know it might have been a consequence being antillean who more scifi than us\\xa0 the presence of yuniors footnotes therefore remind the reader that there is always more to ones story\\nyunior even makes reference in the footnotes to his present life earlier in the novel than when he describes it in chapter eight in my first draft saman was actually jarabacoa but then my girl leonie resident expert in all things domo pointed out that there are no beaches in jarabacoa yunior thus builds the writing of the novel and his relationship with oscar into the greater history of the dominican republic the many science fiction references throughout the novel and footnotes emphasize yunior believes the fantastical elements of dominican history yunior cites the fall of mordor and the dispelling of evil from middle earth from the lord of the rings as a complement to the fall of trujillo\\nthe footnotes contain many references specifically to the reign of rafael trujillo from 1930 to 1961 providing historical background on figures like the mirabal sisters who were assassinated by trujillo and anacaona an indigenous woman who fought against the invading spanish colonialists while referencing historical figures yunior frequently includes the novels fictional characters in the historical events\\nbut what was even more ironic was that abelard had a reputation for being able to keep his head down during the worst of the regimes madnessfor unseeing as it were in 1937 for example while the friends of the dominican republic were perejiling haitians and haitiandominicans and haitianlooking dominicans to death while genocide was in fact in the making abelard kept his head eyes and nose safely tucked into his books let his wife take care of hiding his servants didnt ask her nothing about it and when survivors staggered into his surgery with unspeakable machete wounds he fixed them up as best he could without making any comments as to the ghastliness of their wounds\\nyunior thus builds a context for the dominican history where the characters are used just as much in the footnotes as they are in the body of the novel\\nmany of the footnotes ultimately connect back to themes of coming to a new world underscored through the novels references to fantasy and scifi or having ones own world completely changed trujillos reign as revealed in the footnotes of the novel becomes just as dystopian as one of oscars favorite science fiction novels\\nslang\\ndaz moves between several styles in the novel as the narrative shifts to each of the characters oscars speech reflects an autodidactic language based on his knowledge of fantasy nerd literature and his speech is filled with phrases such as i think shes orchidaceous and i do not move so precipitously whereas yunior affects a bilingual bboy flow and intersperses it with literary language the story of the de lon family is told and collected by the fictional narrator yunior and the new york times critic michiko kakutani has described the voice of the book as a streetwise brand of spanglish he often gives his own commentary and analysis on the events he is relating in the story and sometimes reveals failings in his own life both as a narrator and a person players never never never fuck with a bitch named awilda because when she awildas out on your ass youll know pain for real\\nhis informal and frequent use of neologisms can be seen in sentences such as a description of trujillo as the dictatingest dictator who ever dictated or his description of the effectiveness of trujillos secret police force you could say a bad thing about el jefe at eightforty in the morning and before the clock struck ten youd be in the cuarenta having a cattleprod shoved up your ass\\noscar wao also oscillates between english and spanish yunior peppers the englishspeaking novel with spanish vocabulary and phrases and certain english sentences are built with spanish syntax beli might have been a puta major in the cosmology of her neighbors but a cuero she was not\\noscar lives his life surrounded by the culture of fantasy and as oscar describes them the more speculative genres and the language of these cultures is strewn throughout the book along with spanish brief phrases relating to games like dungeons amp dragons and tabletop roleplaying game terms are used as common colloquialisms he oscar could have refused could have made a saving throw against torture but instead he went with the flow\\nmagical realism\\nthe brief and wondrous life of oscar wao contains several of the hallmarks of latin american magical realism the novels plot is intricately bound up with the notion of fuk americanus which is generally a curse of doom of some kind specifically the curse or doom of the new world the reliance on fuk and its counterpart zafa gives the novel a fantastical element which show magical realisms part in the plot as the narrative follows the impact of the supernatural curse this is coupled with other supernatural elements such as the man with no face and the mongoose\\nthe fantastical elements of the novel take place in both new jersey and in the dominican republic this combination establishes a real world setting for these events which blends the natural with the supernatural another attribute of magical realism\\nin addition of the fantastical elements of the novel oscar wao also includes a degree of political critique in the discussion of the trujillo dictatorship of the dominican republic as well as a portrayal of metafiction in oscars own writing on fantasy novels both political critique and metafiction are typical features of magical realism\\ndaz also hints at the novels magical realist elements by claiming that fku was popular in places like macondo which is the fictional setting for one hundred years of solitude by gabriel garcia marquez which is seen as one of the most prominent latin american magical realist novels\\nspeculative fiction\\nthe brief wondrous life of oscar wao can be used as an example of speculative fiction speculative fiction is a subcategory of fiction that deals with ideas that are not directly real but rather imaginative or futuristic the plot of this novel skips from past to present and focuses on different characters stories at various times to convey the longlasting impression that rafael trujillos dictatorship in the dominican republic from 1930 to 1961 left to emphasize the brutality of the past the novel blends aspects of scifi and fantasy with horror as well as popular culture by combining all of these elements diaz creates a work of speculative fiction that holds various social critiques\\nusing trujillo as a minor character\\nthe novel uses history to set the scene and create its social and political commentary the basis of all of the problems that arise in this novel is the ussponsored dictatorship of rafael trujillo that lasted for over thirty years junot diaz surely includes trujillo as a character in the story but limits his representation to descriptions that come from yuniors perspective because of this trujillo has an important role in the story but is ultimately weakened due to the given perspective diaz creates irony using this strong dictator as a minor character and focusing on the characters that would have otherwise been marginalized this arrangement destabilizes established power hierarchies putting more emphasis on the seemingly least powerful characters and taking power away from the most prominent and infamous characters\\nfurthermore when trujillo is referenced by yunior in his narration the descriptions are entirely negative yuniors references show little respect and are meant to belittle trujillos presence in the story by actively disparaging the brutal dictator diaz breaks social and cultural norms about how common people function in a power hierarchy yunior is given the power to represent trujillo which lessens trujillos dominance in the power scale allowing the novel to have a strong stance against the dictatorship stripping trujillo of the meaning behind his title overall making trujillo the minor character allows trujillo to be seen as more of a joke than a strong leader while also enforcing the seriousness and longlasting effects of his power\\nlolas daughter\\nthroughout the novel diaz uses metaphors and symbols to present dominican history as well as the fuku curse lola is oscars older sister and her daughter serves as a symbol of the potential to break the fuku curse lolas daughter is a character that holds the future for the de leon family and symbolically the entire dominican culture she symbolizes the dominican identity struggle of growing up with two cultural ties that of the dominican republic and that of the united states although in the story her character does not know her own role she must accept and embrace her dominican culture to break the curse this sense of uncertainty towards this fantastical curse allows the novel to speculate as to how it can be broken the curse itself is meant to be a defining factor of dominican culture diaz ties in lolas daughters character with breaking the curse to show that the future of dominican culture is to be defined by aspects others that a history of oppression and colonization the idea that an individual has the power the change the effects of the curse in their own life is a way for the novel to show that dominican culture can be changed in a way that marginalized people can have power\\nyunior as the narrator\\nalthough yunior is the narrator of the story and everything that is said comes from his perspective the story revolves around the unlikely hero oscar oscar is a shy overweight teenager who loves to read and write science fiction and fantasy and is searching for love he is constantly deemed not masculine enough by those around him and he does not follow the norms of his dominican culture he too is affected by the fuku curse that stems from a long history of oppression and the only way for him to break free is to acknowledge his own culture while also adapting to his new surroundings in the united states oscars characters love for science fiction allows diaz to intertwine metaphors from the science fiction realm such as that of watchmen this reference allows diaz to propose the question of whether or not it is just to save humanity by killing a human and make parallels to oscars decision running away with ybon as well as the future of dominican culture and history by referencing nothing ever ends on page 331 in the novel diaz proposes that the past cannot be changed but must ultimately be accepted to create a better future and reclaim the culture\\noscars story is not the only one that yunior tells yunior covers multiple generations of the de leon family history to emphasize the transgenerational struggles and the inheritance of the fuku curse because of the way that the story is narrated the readers get a comprehensive view of the cultural factors that surround oscar that ultimately lead to his tragic death diaz shows that the mistakes made in oscars family lead to oscars fate providing a cautionary tale for the future of dominican culture in a fantastical context furthermore yunior recounts the stories and history of a family that is not his own he is invested with the telling of their story but is simultaneously reserved he even admits that as the one telling the story he holds a certain amount of power by reconstructing the de leon family story and not letting the characters speak for themselves yunior subconsciously follows the trujillan model of narration suppressing their own stories for his own mental gain whether it be a recreated connection to lola his exgirlfriend or oscar his friend\\neven when talking about oscar yunior does not focus on the fact that he is nerdy and does not hide it but rather makes allusions to science fiction and fantasy works that oscar would be familiar with yunior also shows that he and oscar were not so different after all but the difference was in the fact that oscar was not able to hide the fact that he was an outcast while yunior was able to fit in while keeping his unique qualities and interests to himself\\nthemes and motifs\\nthe mongoose\\nmongooses appear throughout the brief wondrous life of oscar wao as guardians of the family historically the mongoose was imported from asia during the 18th century mongooses were imported to tropical islands such as the dominican republic jamaica and hawaii used to protect sugar cane fields from rat infestations mongooses were pivotal in the drs growing sugar economy while the mongoose is transplanted from asia it retroactively becomes a norm within the drs plantation system while the mongoose guides beli its presence is necessary for sugar production the mongoose is known for its sociability and cunning like the de leon family the mongoose is an immigrant an invasive nonnative species the mongoose was transplanted westward to the dominican republic just as oscars family was forced out of the dominican republic daz has stated the importance of the mongoose as being alien creating an otherworldly quality to its assistance furthermore in a footnote the mongoose is described as an enemy of kingly charriots chains and hierarchies an ally of man suggesting the mongooses importance in helping the de leon family not just for their misfortune but also as a means of undermining trujillos oppression\\nat the most superficial level the mongoose can be equated with the zafa the counterspell to the familys fuk for example when beli is beaten in the canefield a creature that would have been an amiable mongoose if not for its golden lion eyes and the absolute black of its pelt motivates beli and sings to her to guide her out of the canefield the creature acts as her protector saving her after the atrocities just committed against her the mongoose further stops a bus directly in front of her preventing her from being hit and providing her transportation to safety similarly oscar remembers a golden mongoose which appeared just before he throws himself from the bridge and again when he is beaten in the canefield for the first time in the canefield the mongoose talks to oscar and saves him just as beli was saved furthermore just as the singing mongoose leads beli to safety a singing voice leads clives to oscar\\nthis symbolic relationship is heightened by the transient nature of the mongoose disappearing as suddenly as it appears each time the mysterious animal appears in a time of dire need the narrator includes a disclaimer on the accuracy in the visions of the creature in the case of beli in the cane fields the narrator shares that whether her encounter with the mongoose was a figment of belis wracked imagination or something else altogether cannot be determined 149 whether or not this creature is a figment of the young womans imagination it led her to safety and provided hope in a situation where death seemed imminent in having this character take on such a surreal nature with characteristics not found in most mongooses such as the ability to talk and vanishing in the blink of an eye daz establishes an uncertainty that mirrors the controversies over whether superstitions exist while the encounters with the creature may or may not have happened their significance in the book still holds strong just like the superstitions because no matter what you believe the fuk believes in you 5 the connection between a superstition and a magical character is more easily followed than one with an ordinary animal highlighting the mongoose being a zafa against the de leons fuk\\ncanefields\\nthe reappearances of canefields in oscar wao are symbolic the scenes of physical violence against beli and oscar are set in this specific geographical space of the sugar canefields sugar was introduced to the dominican republic and haiti then hispaniola through colonialism sugar and canefields were so important to the spanish as they fueled their wealth and the creation of a white elite and thus plantation economy in hispaniola\\nthey first appear when beli is kidnapped and taken to be beaten in a canefield here the canefields are surrounded by the context of the trujillato after unknowingly becoming involved with trujillos sisters husband the gangsters men assault beli there the canefields are thus a violent space where trujillos henchpeople also take care of business as written in footnotes the mirabal sisters were murdered there too in this section of the book yunior says canefields are no fucking joke and even the cleverest of adults can get mazed in their endlessness only to reappear months later as a cameo of bones much later after oscar returns home to la incas to try to be with ybn he also ends up assaulted in a canefield but this time by the capitans friends a lot of the emotions and the atmosphere laid out in oscars canefield scene parallels belis\\nthe canefields in the dominican republic are a space made significant through their history of slavery and violencea racialized space canefields are where enslaved africans were forced into labor and dehumanization these beli and oscar canefield scenes are haunted by the displacement and violence against enslaved africans the displacement and genocide of indigenous folks and also the revolts and resistance to these systems\\npower of appearance\\nbeli understood how advantageous appearance is in the social situations of the dominican republic but not until she had undergone major physical and psychological changes beli desired the same romantic experience as oscar despising school in her early years from being completely alone 83 her loneliness derived from her defensive and aggressive and mad overactive personality that pushed people miles away from her unlike oscar however her predicament reversed becoming not one of a lack of power but an abundance she had to choose whether or not to take advantage of her new curvaceous body which puberty had generously bestowed upon her with these new curves she was thrown into a world where she could get what she wanted where she was given attention without having to ask for it her modellike body presented her with the relationships that she could have never attained otherwise after recovering from her initial shock of the metamorphosis she discovered how her desirability was in its own way power 94 she had been presented with a magical sceptre that allowed her to satisfy her desires asking her not to abuse that power was akin to as daz says it asking the persecuted fat kid not to use his recently discovered mutant abilities 94 by using her appearance she gained a complete understanding of the influences of her body\\nthe power of appearance in the era of trujillo can not be underestimated as seen by its dangerous consequences in the de len family history abelard luis cabral oscars grandfather learned this first hand after repeatedly refusing to bring his firstborn daughter jacquelyn to trujillos events trujillos rapacity towards women knew no bounds employing hundreds of spies whose entire job was to scour the provinces for his next piece of ass 217 trujillos appetite for ass was insatiable 217 pushing him to do unspeakable things his culture of placing appearance above all else does nothing to deemphasize appearance in dominican culture seeing as in a normal political atmosphere people follow their leaders much less in the tightly controlled trujillan dictatorship abelard by withholding his daughters offthehook looks 216 from trujillo he was in effect committing treason 217 his actions eventually resulted in trujillo arranging for his arrest and eighteenyear sentence where he was brutally beaten and treated to an endless series of electric shock treatments 237 during his imprisonment socorro committed suicide jackie was found drowned in a pool astrid is struck by a stray bullet and his third child is born 248250 abelard and socorros third child a daughter they name belicia was born black a terrible thing for the dominicans who viewed having a child of black complexion as an ill omen 248 they felt so strongly about this that yunior offering his own opinion comments i doubt anybody inside the family wanted her to live either 252 she eventually was tossed around the extended family and eventually sold yes thats rightshe was sold 253 all of these tragedies as a result of the desire for a beautiful young lady a by product of the preeminence given to physical appearance\\neven under trujillo however the power of appearance is called into the question as appearances power ultimately takes second place to the power of words cabral is incarcerated tortured and almost destroyed at least in part as a result of words he has spoken and written and trujillo has cabrals entire library including any sample of his handwriting destroyed as trujillo never attempts to sleep with jackie the narrator and reader are left to wonder if at some level the motivation for this family ruin has to do with silencing a powerful voice\\nreexamining masculinity through yunior and oscar\\nyunior and oscar are character foils that illustrate two different types of masculinity if oscars nerdiness fatness and awkwardness make him the antithesis of dominican hypermasculinity then yunior as a don juan and a state school player who can bench 340 pounds 170 is the embodiment of that identity they also have completely opposite values while yunior cheats habitually and cant appreciate even the most beautiful and loving women oscar is faithful and sees beauty in a middleaged prostitute while yunior doesnt value sex for anything other than physical pleasure at least not at first oscar refuses to go to brothels 279 yuniors masculinity echoes that of trujillo who in his violent actions and lust for women also embodies dominican hypermasculinity\\ndespite their differences yunior and oscar become important to each other and develop an unusual friendship as oscar has no father or brothers yunior is the only male with whom he can discuss his romantic yearnings yunior is his access into masculinity as for yunior oscar models an alternative form of masculinity and ultimately pushes him to reexamine his ideas about manhood vanbeest points out that in spite oscars lack of machismo he possesses other masculine traits that yunior admires for example yunior envies the way oscar can develop friendships with women like jenni and talk to them about nonsexual topics he also respects oscars writing style and his ability to write dialogue crack snappy exposition keep the narrative moving 173 finally although oscar dies in the end yunior admires how he was able to achieve real intimacy with a girl by being loving faithful and vulnerable vanbeest argues that oscar succeeds in educating yunior indirectly in the responsibilities of manhood after oscars death yunior claims that it is oscars influence that encourages him to stop following the dictates of el machismo and finally settle down and get married at the end of the novel yunior manages to develop a healthier form of masculinity that allows him to love others and to achieve intimacy\\nthrough yunior and oscars friendship daz critically examines dominican machismo and shows how it can lead to violence and an inability to connect with others through the figure of oscar he explores alternatives to hypermasculinity if fuk is the manifestation of the masculine ideals imposed on the dominican republic herself then is oscar the zafa of this fuk\\nfilling the blank pages  stories as zafa for the fuk of violence\\nthroughout the novel violence is transmitted from the system of colonialism and dictators to the domestic sphere and perpetuated through the generations virtually all the relationships in the book  trujillo and abelard beli and the gangster beli and lola oscar and ybn  are marked with physical or emotional abuse violence is an aspect of the fuk or curse that haunts the cabrals and de leons\\nat the very beginning of the novel it is explained that zafa is the one way to prevent disaster from coiling around you only one surefire counterspell that would keep you and your family safe 7 in this way zafa can be read as an undoing of colonialism because as fuku brings misery and bad luck zafa has the potential to foil it and restore a more favorable balance\\nalthough by the end none of the characters seem to have escaped the cycle of violence or the effects of fuk yunior has a dream in which oscar waves a blank book at him and he realizes that this can be a zafa 325 to the family curse yunior also has hope that isis lolas daughter will one day come to him asking for stories about her family history and if shes smart and as brave as im expecting shell be shell take all weve done and all weve learned and add her own insights and shell put an end to it the fuk 331 thus the empty pages in yuniors dreams signify that the future has yet to be written despite the checkered past in both his life and in the painful history of oppression and colonialism in the dominican republic on the other hand isis potentially coming to yunior to learn more about her uncle represents gaining an understanding of the past which is key to decolonizing and pinpointing the structures that are systematically oppressive yunior implies that storytelling is a way to acknowledge the past and its influence over ones life a way to make sense of what has happened and is the starting point for healing\\nwith the absence of any embodiments of white characters to emphasize the lasting impact of the colonial imaginary the mysticism behind the fuku and zafa become that much more convincing when interpreted as magic instead of as the literal actions of white people the fuku and zafa transcend human beings and remind us that even when colonialism is not particularly obvious it is a force that looms over all and its effects must first be confronted before anyone can take action accordingly as yuniors dream suggests\\nin an interview with edwidge danticat junot daz comments\\nfor me though the real issue in the book is not whether or not one can vanquish the fukbut whether or not one can even see it acknowledge its existence at a collective level to be a true witness to who we are as a people and to what has happened to us that is the essential challenge for the caribbean nationswho as you pointed out have been annihilated by history and yet whove managed to put themselves together in an amazing way thats why i thought the book was somewhat hopeful at the end\\nliterary allusions\\ncomic books sciencefiction and fantasy literature all play an important role in oscars upbringing and identity and each is incorporated into the novel to reflect the world he lives in daz has said that to dismiss the novels reflexivity with fiction and fantasy is to do to the novel exactly what oscar suffered from which is thatoscars interests his views of the world were dismissed as illegitimate as unimportant as makebelieve and that the novel asks the reader to take not only oscar seriously but his interests seriously\\ncomic books\\nthe novel opens with the epigraph of what import are brief nameless livesto galactus daz has said that this question can be read as being directed at the reader because in some ways depending on how you answer that question it really decides whether youre galactus or not in the fantastic four comic book however galactus is asking the question of uatu the watcher whose role is played out in dazs novel by the narrator yunior indicating to daz that the question is both a question to the reader but also a question to writers in general\\nearly in the novel daz aligns oscar with comic book superheroes you want to know what being an xman feels like just be a smart bookish boy of color in a contemporary us ghettolike having bat wings or a pair of tentacles growing out of your chest daz hints at possible latent abilities or qualities oscar may possess that will reveal themselves or develop later in the novel\\nthe novel describes the history of relationships between dictators and journalists in terms of comic book rivalries as well since before the infamous caesarovid war theyve dictators and writers had beef like the fantastic four and galactus like the xmen and the brotherhood of evil mutants like the teen titans and deathstroke\\nthere is also a strong suggestion that the fantastical element of oscars life is a powerful method for him to relate to other people and to the world around him when he examines his own body in the mirror he feels straight out of a daniel clowes book or like the fat blackish kid in beto hernndezs palomar oscars vast memory of comic books and fantasysciencefiction is recalled whenever he is involved in the text and his identity is multiform composed of scraps of comic book marginalia\\ndaz creates a distinct link between human beings performative nature and the masks required to express it and the masks worn by superheroes when oscar meets ana one of the many women with whom he falls in love he notices different aspects of her life and there was something in the seamlessness with which she switched between these aspects that convinced him that both were masks daz connects the removal of masks with both the intimacy that springs from vulnerability and the concept of identity hidden or otherwise oscars infinite capacity for empathy and connection with other human beings is a superpower in its own right contemporary masculinity and contemporary power structures leave no room for vulnerability but for daz the only way to encounter a human is by being vulnerable the man with no face who reoccurs in several parts of the novel can also be read as a sort of mask embodying the fuk\\nfantasy and sciencefiction\\ndaz frequently uses references to works of sciencefiction and fantasy these references serve both to illuminate the world that oscar lives in and create a parallel between the supernatural events in fantasy literature and the history of the dominican republic in the opening pages of the novel the narrator quotes oscar as having said what more scifi than santo domingo what more fantasy than the antilles one of dazs frequent references to j r r tolkien comes when he describes trujillo homeboy dominated santo domingo like it was his very own private mordor in another section felix wenceslao bernardino an agent of trujillo is metaphorically described as the witchking of angmar\\nnear the end of the book diz comprehensively links the fantasy world of middleearth with the world of the dominican republic and the novel\\ntwice in the novel the mantra fear is the mindkiller is repeated the phrase originated in the frank herbert novel dune and oscar uses it to try and quell his own fear near the end of the story to no avail\\nalso daz references stephen king on a number of occasions including a reference to captain trips the fictional virus that wipes out mankind in the stand as well as two references to its characters harold lauder compared to oscar and to mother abigail compared to la inca likewise there is a mention of being flung into the macroverse by the ritual of chud a nod to the ending of it\\ncritical reception\\nthe brief wondrous life of oscar wao was widely praised and appeared in a number of best of the year book lists the book won the john sargent sr first novel prize the dayton peace prize in fiction the national book critics circle award and the pulitzer prize for fiction in 2008 new york magazine named it the best novel of the year and time magazines lev grossman named it the best work of fiction published in 2007 praising it as a massive heaving sparking tragicomedy in a poll of american literary critics organised by bbc culture the arts and culture section of the international bbc website in 2015 the brief wondrous life of oscar wao was voted the twentyfirst centurys best novel so far\\nin a 2009 poll by the millions a panel of writers critics and editors voted the brief wondrous life of oscar wao the eighthbest novel since 2000 and readers ranked it in first place\\nadaptations\\na staged version of the novel called fuk americanus was adapted by sean san jose and codirected by san jose and marc bamuthi joseph through san joses campo santo theatre company in 2009 the production received mixed reviews with critic robert hurwitt stating that fuk doesnt show us how that works or what the curse has to do with anything\\xa0 for that you have to read the book\\nin 2019 repertorio espaol produced la breve y maravillosa vida de oscar wao a spanishlanguage adaptation of the novel at gramercy arts theatre in new york\\nfilm\\nthe novels film rights were optioned by miramax films and producer scott rudin in 2007 director walter salles and writer jose rivera the motorcycle diaries were hired by rudin to adapt the novel according to daz miramaxs rights on the book have since expired'}, {'title': 'War_and_Peace', 'label': 'Book', 'text': 'war and peace  prereform russian   is a literary work mixed with chapters on history and philosophy by the russian author leo tolstoy first published serially then published in its entirety in 1869 it is regarded as one of tolstoys finest literary achievements and remains an internationally praised classic of world literature\\nthe novel chronicles the french invasion of russia and the impact of the napoleonic era on tsarist society through the stories of five russian aristocratic families portions of an earlier version titled the year 1805 were serialized in the russian messenger from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869\\ntolstoy said war and peace is not a novel even less is it a poem and still less a historical chronicle large sections especially the later chapters are philosophical discussions rather than narrative the writer rewrote the novel several times tolstoy also said that the best russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call war and peace a novel instead he regarded anna karenina as his first true novel\\ncomposition history\\ntolstoy began writing war and peace in 1863 the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate in september of that year he wrote to elizabeth bers his sisterinlaw asking if she could find any chronicles diaries or records that related to the napoleonic period in russia he was dismayed to find that few written records covered the domestic aspects of russian life at that time and tried to rectify these omissions in his early drafts of the novel the first half of the book was written and named 1805 during the writing of the second half he read widely and acknowledged schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations tolstoy wrote in a letter to afanasy fet that what he had written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation however tolstoy approaches it from the other side\\nthe first draft of the novel was completed in 1863 in 1865 the periodical the russian messenger published the first part of this draft under the title 1805 and published more the following year tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867 he heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869 tolstoys wife sophia tolstaya copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before tolstoy considered it ready for publication the version that was published in had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title war and peace in 1869 russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel and it sold out almost immediately the novel was immediately translated after publication into many other languages\\nit is unknown why tolstoy changed the name to war and peace he may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of pierrejoseph proudhon war and peace in french the title may also be another reference to titus described as being a master of war and peace in the twelve caesars written by suetonius in 119\\nthe completed novel was then called  in newstyle orthography in english war and peace\\nthe 1805 manuscript was reedited and annotated in russia in 1893 and has been since translated into english german french spanish dutch swedish finnish albanian korean and czech\\ntolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel his narrative structure is noted not only for its gods eye point of view over and within events but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed an individual characters view point his use of visual detail is often comparable to cinema using literary techniques that resemble panning wide shots and closeups these devices while not exclusive to tolstoy are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid19th century and of which tolstoy proved himself a master\\nthe standard russian text of war and peace is divided into four books comprising fifteen parts and an epilogue in two parts roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters whereas the latter parts as well as the second part of the epilogue increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war power history and historiography tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely while others published even during tolstoys life simply moved these essays into an appendix\\nrealism\\nthe novel is set 60 years before tolstoys day but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 french invasion of russia he read all the standard histories available in russian and french about the napoleonic wars and had read letters journals autobiographies and biographies of napoleon and other key players of that era there are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in war and peace\\nhe worked from primary source materials interviews and other documents as well as from history books philosophy texts and other historical novels tolstoy also used a great deal of his own experience in the crimean war to bring vivid detail and firsthand accounts of how the imperial russian army was structured\\ntolstoy was critical of standard history especially military history in war and peace he explains at the start of the novels third volume his own views on how history ought to be written\\nlanguage\\nalthough the book is mainly in russian significant portions of dialogue are in french it has been suggested that the use of french is a deliberate literary device to portray artifice while russian emerges as a language of sincerity honesty and seriousness it could however also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written since french was the common language of the russian aristocracy and more generally the aristocracies of continental europe at the time in fact the russian nobility often knew only enough russian to command their servants tolstoy illustrates this by showing that julie karagina a character in the novel is so unfamiliar with her countrys native language that she has to take russian lessons\\nthe use of french diminishes as the book progresses it is suggested that this is to demonstrate russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination and to show that a oncefriendly nation has turned into an enemy by midway through the book several of the russian aristocracy are eager to find russian tutors for themselves\\nbackground and historical context\\nthe novel spans the period from 1805 to 1820 the era of catherine the great was still fresh in the minds of older people catherine had made french the language of her royal court for the next 100 years it became a social requirement for the russian nobility to speak french and understand french culture\\nthe historical context of the novel begins with the execution of louis antoine duke of enghien in 1805 while russia is ruled by alexander i during the napoleonic wars key historical events woven into the novel include the ulm campaign the battle of austerlitz the treaties of tilsit and the congress of erfurt tolstoy also references the great comet of 1811 just before the french invasion of russia\\ntolstoy then uses the battle of ostrovno and the battle of shevardino redoubt in his novel before the occupation of moscow and the subsequent fire the novel continues with the battle of tarutino the battle of maloyaroslavets the battle of vyazma and the battle of krasnoi the final battle cited is the battle of berezina after which the characters move on with rebuilding moscow and their lives\\nprincipal characters\\nthe novel tells the story of five familiesthe bezukhovs the bolkonskys the rostovs the kuragins and the drubetskoys\\nthe main characters are\\nin addition several reallife historical characters such as

victories later in the battle however andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero napoleon but his previous enthusiasm has been shattered he no longer thinks much of napoleon so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear compared to that lofty righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended tolstoy portrays austerlitz as an early test for russia one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce according to tolstoy a victory at borodino during the 1812 invasion\\nbook two\\nbook two begins with nikolai rostov briefly returning on leave to moscow accompanied by his friend denisov his officer from his pavlograd regiment he spends an eventful

would do something with which even his late father would be satisfied presumably as a revolutionary in the decembrist revolt\\nsecond part\\nthe second part of the epilogue contains tolstoys critique of all existing forms of mainstream history the 19thcentury great man theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of heroes and other great individuals tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events rather he argues great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved he compares this to calculus and the sum of infinitesimals he then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and freewill necessity being based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis and freewill being based on consciousness and therefore inherently unpredictable\\nreception\\nthe novel that made its author the true lion of the russian literature according to ivan goncharov enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays some of which by dmitry pisarev pavel annenkov dragomirov and strakhov formed the basis for the research of later tolstoy scholars yet the russian presss initial response to the novel was muted with most critics unable to decide how to classify it the liberal newspaper golos the voice april 3 93 1865 was one of the first to react its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others what could this possibly be what kind of genre are we supposed to file it to where is fiction in it and where is real history\\nwriter and critic nikolai akhsharumov writing in 6 1867 suggested that war and peace was neither a chronicle nor a historical novel but a genre merger this ambiguity never undermining its immense value annenkov who praised the novel too was equally vague when trying to classify it the cultural history of one large section of our society the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century was his suggestion it is the social epic the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nations life wrote ivan turgenev in his bid to define war and peace in the foreword for his french translation of the two hussars published in paris by in 1875\\nin general the literary left received the novel coldly they saw it as devoid of social critique and keen on the idea of national unity they saw its major fault as the authors inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel as critic varfolomey zaytsev put it articles by d minayev and n shelgunov in magazine characterized the novel as lacking realism showing its characters as cruel and rough mentally stoned morally depraved and promoting the philosophy of stagnation still mikhail saltykovschedrin who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with how strongly this count has stung our higher society dmitry pisarev in his unfinished article russian gentry of old   2 1868 while praising tolstoys realism in portraying members of high society was still unhappy with the way the author as he saw it idealized the old nobility expressing unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards the russian dvoryanstvo on the opposite front the conservative press and patriotic authors a s norov and p a vyazemsky among them were accusing tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history desecrating the patriotic feelings of our fathers and ridiculing dvoryanstvo\\none of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of pavel annenkov published in 2 1868 issue of vestnik evropy the critic praised tolstoys masterful portrayal of man at war marveled at the complexity of the whole composition organically merging historical facts and fiction the dazzling side of the novel according to annenkov was the natural simplicity with which the author transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two great raznotchintsys speransky and arakcheev and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel this relatively rough but original element in the end the critic called the novel the whole epoch in the russian fiction\\nslavophiles declared tolstoy their  and pronounced war and peace the bible of the new national idea several articles on war and peace were published in 186970 in zarya magazine by nikolai strakhov war and peace is the work of genius equal to everything that the russian literature has produced before he pronounced in the first smaller essay it is now quite clear that from 1868 when the war and peace was published the very essence of what we call russian literature has become quite different acquired the new form and meaning the critic continued later strakhov was the first critic in russia who declared tolstoys novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in russian literature still being a true slavophile he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major slavophiliac ideas of meek russian characters supremacy over the rapacious european kind using apollon grigorievs formula years later in 1878 discussing strakhovs own book the world as a whole tolstoy criticized both grigorievs concept of russian meekness vs western bestiality and strakhovs interpretation of it\\namong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of tolstoys battle scenes n lachinov a member of the russky invalid newspaper staff 69 april 10 1868 called the battle of schngrabern scenes bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness and totally agreed with the authors view on the battle of borodino which some of his opponents disputed the army general and respected military writer mikhail dragomirov in an article published in the military almanac 186870 while disputing some of tolstoys ideas concerning the spontaneity of wars and the role of commander in battles advised all the russian army officers to use war and peace as their desk book describing its battle scenes as incomparable and serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art\\nunlike professional literary critics most prominent russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly goncharov turgenev leskov dostoyevsky and fet have all gone on record as declaring war and peace the masterpiece of the russian literature ivan goncharov in a july 17 1878 letter to pyotr ganzen advised him to choose for translating into danish war and peace adding this is positively what might be called a russian iliad embracing the whole epoch it is the grandiose literary event showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master  this is one of the most if not the most profound literary work ever in 1879 unhappy with ganzen having chosen anna karenina to start with goncharov insisted war and peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel both in content and execution it also serves as a monument to russian historys glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus a statue in bronze even the novels minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the russian people and its life in 1885 expressing satisfaction with the fact that tolstoys works had by then been translated into danish goncharov again stressed the immense importance of war and peace count tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here in russia he remarked\\nfyodor dostoyevsky in a may 30 1871 letter to strakhov described war and peace as the last word of the landlords literature and the brilliant one at that in a draft version of the raw youth he described tolstoy as a historiograph of the  or rather its cultural elite the objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes and alongside people of talent honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels worthless goons and fools he added in 1876 dostoyevsky wrote my strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledgenot only of the poetic side of his art but also the reality he deals with in its historical as well as contemporary context here in russia as far as i see it only one writer excels in this count lev tolstoy\\nnikolai leskov then an anonymous reviewer in the stock exchange herald wrote several articles praising highly war and peace calling it the best ever russian historical novel and the pride of the contemporary literature marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of tolstoys book leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for having lifted up the peoples spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved while working most elaborately upon individual characters the author apparently has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the army that came up to fight mighty napoleon in this respect the novel of count tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers leskov wrote\\nafanasy fet in a january 1 1870 letter to tolstoy expressed his great delight with the novel youve managed to show us in great detail the other mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer heroic side of it he added\\nivan turgenev gradually reconsidered his initial skepticism as to the novels historical aspect and also the style of tolstoys psychological analysis in his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to edmond abou the editor of the french newspaper  turgenev described tolstoy as the most popular russian writer and war and peace as one of the most remarkable books of our age this vast work has the spirit of an epic where the life of russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master  the manner in which count tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original this is the great work of a great writer and in it theres true real russia turgenev wrote it was largely due to turgenevs efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the european readership the first french edition of the war and peace 1879 paved the way for the worldwide success of leo tolstoy and his works\\nsince then many worldfamous authors have praised war and peace as a masterpiece of world literature gustave flaubert expressed his delight in a january 1880 letter to turgenev writing this is the first class work what an artist and what a psychologist the first two volumes are exquisite i used to utter shrieks of delight while reading this is powerful very powerful indeed later john galsworthy called war and peace the best novel that had ever been written romain rolland remembering his reading the novel as a student wrote this work like life itself has no beginning no end it is life itself in its eternal movement thomas mann thought war and peace to be the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature ernest hemingway confessed that it was from tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to write about war in the most straightforward honest objective and stark way i dont know anybody who could write about war better than tolstoy did hemingway asserted in his 1955 men at war the best war stories of all time anthology\\nisaak babel said after reading war and peace if the world could write by itself it would write like tolstoy tolstoy gives us a unique combination of the naive objectivity of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism this is the reason for our trust in his presentation\\nenglish translations\\nwar and peace has been translated into many languages it has been translated into english on several occasions starting with clara bell working from a french translation the translators constance garnett and louise and aylmer maude knew tolstoy personally translations have to deal with tolstoys often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions only about 2 percent of war and peace is in french tolstoy removed the french in a revised 1873 edition only to restore it later most translators follow garnett retaining some french briggs uses no french while pevearvolokhonsky and amy mandelkers revision of the maude translation both retain the french fully\\nlist of english translations\\nfull translations\\nabridged translation\\ntranslation of draft of 1863\\ncomparing translations\\nin the encyclopedia of literary translation into english academic zoja pavlovskispetit has this to say about the translations of war and peace available in 2000 of all the translations of war and peace dunnigans 1968 is the best  unlike the other translators dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically russian folk expressions and proverbs  she is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering for instance the statement that boriss mother pronounced his name with a stress on the o  an indication to the russian reader of the old ladys affectation\\non the garnett translation pavlovskispetit writes her war and peace is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms her style is awkward and turgid very unsuitable for tolstoi on the maudes translation she comments this should have been the best translation but the maudes lack of adroitness in dealing with russian folk idiom and their style in general place this version below dunnigans she further comments on edmondss revised translation formerly on penguin it is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of english  a respectable translation but not on the level of dunnigan or

their arms and that a selection of the breakaway states leaders go to lagos and formally surrender to gowon the next day obasanjo spoke on regional radio urging citizens to stay in their homes and guaranteeing their safety many biafrans and foreign media sources feared that the nigerian army would commit widespread atrocities against the defeated population although obasanjo was keen to prevent this he ordered his troops in the region to remain within their barracks maintain that the local police should take responsibility for law and order the third division which was more isolated did carry out reprisal attacks on the local population obasanjo was tough on the perpetrators having those guilty of looting flogged and those guilty of rape shot gowons government made obasanjo responsible for reintegrating biafra into nigeria in which position he earned respect for emphasising magnanimity as an engineer he emphasised restoration of the water supply by may 1970 all major towns in the region were reconnected to the water supply obasanjos role in ending the war made him a war hero and a nationally known figure in nigeria\\npostcivil war career 19701975\\nin june 1970

business temperance enterprises limited through which he could embark on commercial ventures after retiring from the military he also continued to invest in property by 1974 he owned two houses in lagos and one each in ibadan and abeokuta rumours arose that obasanjo engaged in the corruption that was becoming increasingly widespread in nigeria although no hard evidence of this ever emerged his marriage with oluremi became strained as she opposed his relationships with other women in the mid1970s their marriage was dissolved in 1976 he married stella abebe in a traditional yoruba ceremony\\nin murtalas government\\ncoup dtat of 1975 and aftermath\\nin july 1975 a coup led by shehu musa yaradua and joseph garba ousted gowon who fled to britain they had not informed obasanjo of their plans as he was known to be critical of coups as an instrument of regime change the coup plotters wanted to replace gowons autocratic rule with a triumvirate of three brigadiers whose decisions could be vetoed by a supreme military council for this triumvirate they convinced general murtala muhammed to become head of state with obasanjo as his secondincommand and danjuma as the third iliffe noted that of the triumvirate obasanjo was the workhorse and the brains and was the most eager for a return to civilian rule together the triumvirate introduces austerity measures to stem inflation established a corrupt practices investigation bureau replaced all military governors with new officers who reported directly to obasanjo as chief of staff and launched operation deadwood through which they fired 11000 officials from the civil service\\nchief of staff supreme headquarters 197576\\nin october 1975 the government announced plans for an election which would result in civilian rule in

commission the government also announced the creation of seven new states at obasanjos insistence abeokuta was to become the capital of one of these new states ogun also on the commissions recommendation it announced gradual plans to move the nigerian capital from lagos to the more central abuja in january 1976 both obasanjo and danjuma were promoted to the ranks of lieutenant general\\nboth murtala and obasanjo were committed to ending ongoing european colonialism and white minority rule in southern africa a cause reflected in their foreign policy choices this cause increasingly became a preoccupation for obasanjo after angola secured independence from portugal a civil war broke out in the country nigeria recognised the legitimacy of the government declared by the mpla a marxist group backed by the soviet union because the rival fnla and unita were being assisted by the white minority government in south africa as well as providing material aid to the mpla nigeria began lobbying other african countries to also recognise the mpla administration and by early 1976 most states in the organisation of african unity oau had done so in february 1976 obasanjo led a nigerian delegation to an mpla anniversary celebration in luanda where he declared this is a symbolic date marking the beginning of the final struggle against colonialism imperialism and racism in africa\\nmurtalas assassination 13 february 1976\\nin february 1976 colonel buka suka dimka launched a coup against nigerias government during which general murtala muhammed was assassinated an attempt was also made on obasanjos life but the wrong individual was killed dimka lacked widespread support among the military and his coup failed forcing him to flee obasanjo did not attend murtalas funeral in kano but declared that the government would finance construction of a mosque on the burial site\\nafter the assassination obasanjo attended a meeting of the supreme military council he expressed his desire to resign from government but the council successfully urged him to replace murtala as head of state he therefore became the councils chair concerned about further attempts on his life obasanjo moved into the dodan barracks while 39 people accused of being part of dimkas coup were executed generating accusations that obasanjos response was excessive as head of state obasanjo vowed to continue murtalas policies\\nmilitary head of state 19761979\\nmilitary triumvirate\\naware of the danger of alienating northern nigerians obasanjo brought general shehu yaradua as his replacement and secondincommand as chief of staff supreme headquarters completing the military triumvirate with obasanjo as head of state and general theophilus danjuma as chief of army staff the three went on to reestablish control over the military regime obasanjo encouraged debate and consensus among the supreme military council many wondered why obasanjo  as a yoruba and a christian  had appointed yaradua a member of the northern aristocracy as his secondincommand rather than a fellow yoruba christian\\nobasanjo emphasised national concerns over those of the regions he encouraged both children and adults to recite the new national pledge and the national anthem interested in getting a broader range of perspectives each saturday he held an informal seminar on a topical issue to which people other than politicians and civil servants were invited among those whose advice he sought were islamic scholars and traditional chiefs\\neconomic policy\\nby the mid1970s nigeria had an overheated economy with a 34 inflation rate to deal with nigerias economic problems obasanjo pursued austerity measures to reduce public expenditure in his 1976 budget obasanjo proposed to reduce government expenditure by a sixth curtailing prestige projects while spending more on education health housing and agriculture he also set up an antiinflation task force and within a year of obasanjo taking office inflation had fallen to 30 obasanjo was generally adverse to borrowing money but with the support of the world bank and international monetary fund nigeria took out a 1\\xa0billion loan from a syndicate of banks leftist critics argued that doing so left the country subservient to western capitalism in the subsequent two years of obasanjos government nigeria borrowed a further 4983\\xa0million\\nnigeria was undergoing nearly 3 annual population growth during the 1970s something which would double the countrys population in just over 25 years obasanjo later noted that he was unaware of this at the time with his government having no policy on population control nigerias population growth contributed to rapid urbanisation and an urban housing shortage to deal with this obasanjos 1976 budget outlined plans for the construction of 200000 new housing units by 1980 although ultimately only 28500 were built in 1976 obasanjos government also announced rent and price controls to counteract the disruption of labour strikes in 1976 obasanjos government introduced legislation that defined most major industries as essential services banned strikes within them and authorised the detention of disruptive union leaders in 1978 it merged 42 unions into the single nigerian labour congress\\nobasanjo continued with three major irrigation schemes in northern nigeria that were first announced under murtala the kano river project the bakalori scheme and the south chad irrigation project his government also continued the agricultural development projects launched in funtua gusau and gombe some reforestation projects were also initiated to stall the encroachment of the sahara desert in the north to meet the countrys growing demand for electricity obasanjo oversaw the launch of two new hydroelectric projects and a thermal plant the oil industry remained an important part of nigerias economy and under obasanjo the ministry of petroleum resources was merged with the nigerian national oil corporation to form the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc obasanjo also supported the creation of a liquefaction plant at bonny which was 62 financed by the nnpc the project was abandoned by his successor amid spiralling cost increases obasanjo also continued the planning of the ajaokuta integrated steel mill an inherited project that many critics in the civil service argued was unviable\\nin the mid1970s nigeria also faced declining agricultural production a process caused by successive governments finding it cheaper to import food than grow it domestically in may 1976 obasanjo launched operation feed the nation a project to revitalise smallscale farming and which involved students being paid to farm during the holidays the project also involved abolishing duties on livestock feed and farm implements subsidizing the use of fertilisers and easing agricultural credit in march 1978 obasanjo issued the land use decree which gave the state propriety rights over all land this was designed to stop land hoarding and land speculation and brought praise from the nigerian left although was disliked by many landowning families obasanjo saw it as one of his governments main achievements\\ndomestic policies\\nobasanjo continued the push for universal primary education in nigeria a policy inherited from gowon he introduced the primary education act in 1976 between 197576 and 197980 enrolment in free but voluntary primary schooling grew from 6\\xa0million to 125\\xa0million although there was a shortage of teachers and materials to cope with the demand in the 197778 school year obasanjo introduced free secondary educational in technical subjects something extended to all secondary schooling in 197980\\nconcomitantly nigeria cut back on university funding in 1978 it ceased issuing student loans and trebled university food and accommodation charges student protests erupted in several cities resulting in fatal shootings in lagos and zaria in response to the unrest obasanjo closed several universities banned political activity on campus and proscribed the national union of nigerian students the severity of these measures was perhaps due to suspicions that the student unrest was linked to a planned military coup that was uncovered in february 1978 obasanjo was frustrated at the protesting students behaviour arguing that it reflected a turn away from traditional values such as respect for elders\\nas a consequence of nigerias statedirected development the country saw a rapid growth in the public sector evidence emerged of extensive corruption in the countrys government and while accusations were often made against obasanjo himself no hard evidence was produced to hinder the image of corruption in the government obasanjos administration banned the use of mercedes cars as government transport and instead introduced more modest peugeot 504s the import of champagne was also banned pushing for cutbacks in the military obasanjos government saw 12000 soldiers demobilised over the course of 1976 and 1977 these troops went through new rehabilitation centres to assist them in adjusting to civilian life\\nobasanjo was also accused of being responsible for political repression in one famous instance the compound of the nigerian musician and political activist fela kuti kalakuta republic was raided and burned to the ground after a member of his entourage was involved in an altercation with military personnel fela and his family were beaten and raped and his aged mother the political activist and founding mother chief funmilayo ransome kuti was thrown from a window this resulted in serious injuries and eventually led to her death fela subsequently carried a coffin to the then presidential residence at dodan barracks in lagos as a protest against the governments political repression\\nforeign policy\\nobasanjo was eager to establish nigeria as a prominent leader in africa and under his tenure its influence in the continent increased he revived gowons plan to hold the second world black and african festival of arts and culture in nigeria it took place in lagos in february 1977 although domestic critics argued that it was too expensive obasanjo gave low priority to the economic community of west african states ecowas and angered many of its francophone members after insisting that as the largest financial contributor to the organisation nigeria should host the organisations headquarters in lagos relations with nearby ghana also declined in 1979 nigeria cut off oil supplies to the country to protest the execution of political opponents by jerry rawlings new military junta\\nunder obasanjo nigeria loosened its longstanding ties with the united kingdom and aligned more closely with the united states obasanjo was favourable to the us government of jimmy carter who was elected in 1976 because of carters commitment to ensuring majority rule across southern africa carters ambassador to nigeria andrew young formed a close personal friendship with obasanjo while carter visited nigeria in 1978 however the decision to shift allegiances was made for pragmatic rather than ideological reasons the discovery of oil in the north sea meant that the uk had become a competitor rather than a customer of nigerian oil obasanjos government was also angry that the uk refused to extradite gowon and suspected that the british government might have been involved in the coup against murtala for these reasons in 1976 it considered suspending diplomatic relations with the uk but ultimately did not obasanjo nevertheless refused to visit the uk and discouraged his officials from doing so relations were further damaged when margaret thatcher became british prime minister in 1979 initiating a warmer british approach to the white minority administrations of rhodesia and south africa in response nigeria seized a british tanker that was believed to be transporting nigerian oil to south africa banned british firms from competing for nigerian contracts and nationalised british petroleums nigerian operations \\nobasanjo was also eager to hasten the end of white minority rule in southern africa according to iliffe this became the centrepiece of his foreign policy nigeria gave grants to those fighting white minority rule in the region allowed these groups to open offices in lagos and offered sanctuary to various refugees fleeing the governments of southern africa taking a hard line against the apartheid regime in south africa obasanjo announced that nigeria would not take part in the 1976 summer olympics because new zealand which was competing had sporting ties with south africa a country that was banned from competing due to apartheid in 1977 obasanjo barred any contractors with south african links from operating in nigeria the main companies that were hit were british petroleum and barclays bank that same year nigeria hosted the united nations conference for action against apartheid in lagos while obasanjo visited the us in october where he urged the country to stop selling arms to south africa while in the country he addressed the united nations general assembly and two weeks later nigeria received a seat on the united nations security council\\nopposition to white minority rule in rhodesia had sparked the rhodesian bush war and obasanjos government maintained that armed struggle was the only option for overthrowing rhodesias government he encouraged unity among the various antigovernment factions there urging robert mugabe the head of zanu to accept the leadership of his rival joshua nkomo of zapu in 1977 the uk and us drew up proposals for a transition to majority rule in rhodesia amid a period in which the country would be under the management of united nations forces obasanjo backed the plan and visited tanzania zambia mozambique and the democratic republic of congo to urge their governments to do the same however after thatcher became uk prime minister nigeria distanced itself from british efforts to end the rhodesian bush war and was excluded from any significant role in the ukbrokered process that led to multiracial democratic elections in rhodesia\\nas head of state obasanjo attended oau summits at that held in july 1977 he proposed the formation of a standing committee to mediate disputes between oau member states at the 1978 conference he warned of interference from both sides in the cold war at the next conference he urged the formation of a panafrican military which could engage in peacekeeping efforts on the continent to promote nigerias role internationally obasanjo involved himself in various mediation efforts across africa in 1977 he persuaded benin and togo to end their border dispute and reopen their frontier he also attempted to mediate a quarrel among several east african states and thus prevent the collapse of the east african community but failed in this attempt as the chair of the oau mediation committee he tried to mediate the ogaden dispute between ethiopia and somalia but was again unsuccessful he also failed to mend the breach that had emerged between angola and the democratic republic of congo \\non behalf of the oau obasanjo held a conference at kano to mediate the chadian civil war several factions agreed to a ceasefire to form a government of national unity and to allow nigerian troops to act as peacekeepers the war nevertheless continued and nigeria responded by cutting off its oil supply to chad a second conference on the conflict took place in lagos in august 1979 resulting in the formation of another shortlived transitional government in the final year of his military government he headed an oau mission to resolve the conflict in western sahara\\ntransfer of power\\nthe military government has assembled a constituent drafting committee to devise a new constitution which could be used amid a transfer to civilian rule the committee argued that nigeria should change its governance system which was based on the british parliamentary system to one based on the us presidential system whereby a single elected president would be both head of state and head of government to avoid this president becoming a dictator as had happened elsewhere in africa it argued for various checks on their power including a federal structure whereby independent elected institutions would exist at the federal state and local level the draft constitution was published in october 1976 and debated in public for the following year a constituent assembly met to discuss the draft in october 1977 the assembly deadlocked over what role to give sharia law in the constitution obasanjo called the assembly together and warned them of the social impact of their decision urging them to take a more conciliatory attitude in september 1978 the supreme military council announced the new constitution it had made several amendments to the version put forward by the constituent assembly\\nalong with the new constitution obasanjo lifted the ban on political parties a variety of groups then formed to compete in the ensuing election most notably the unity party of yoruba the nigerian peoples party and the national party of nigeria obasanjo was angered that many of the politicians were making promises that they could not keep the elections took place over the course of july and august 1979 turnout was low at between 30 and 40 percent of legally registered voters and there was rigging on various sides although it was peaceful there was debate as to who won the presidential vote and obasanjo refused to adjudicate insisting that the electoral commission take on that role they declared that shehu shagari was the winner something that the runner up obafemi awolowo unsuccessfully challenged at the supreme court shagari took office in october 1979 at his inauguration ceremony obasanjo presented shagari with a copy of the new constitution this marked the start of nigerias second republic\\nobasanjos role in returning nigeria to civilian rule would form the basis of the good reputation he retained for the next two decades however various domestic and foreign individuals including the zambian president kenneth kaunda and togo president gnassingb eyadma urged him to remain in power his refusal to back awolowo a fellow yoruba earned him the enmity of much of the yoruba elite awolowo accused obasanjo of orchestrating shagaris victory something obasanjo strenuously denied\\nprepresidency 19791999\\nbefore he left office in april 1979 obasanjo promoted himself to the role of general as a fourstar general he continued to receive a salary from the state having left office in october he returned to abeokuta following a sixweek course at an agricultural training college obasanjo then set himself up as a farmer hoping to set an example in encouraging agricultural selfreliance he obtained at least 230 hectares of land in ota on which to establish his farm there moving in to a brick farmhouse there was local hostility to his obtaining so much land and much litigation was brought against him because of it his agricultural activities were organised through his temperance enterprises limited later renamed obasanjos farms limited he devoted particular attention to poultry farming by the mid1980s his farm was hatching 140000 chicks a week he developed farms elsewhere in yorubaland and by 1987 he employed over 400 workers at eight locations as did other senior yoruba figures obasanjo sponsored poor students who attended his former school in abeokuta\\nobasanjo grew critical of shagaris civilian government deeming the president weak and illprepared nigeria entered economic recession due to fluctuations in global oil prices in may 1983 senior military figures asked obasanjo to take over control in the country again but he declined in december they overthrew shagari without obasanjos involvement in a coup that saw little violence muhammadu buhari became the new military head of state obasanjo was initially supportive of buharis government stating that representative democracy had failed in nigeria he praised buharis war against indiscipline his halving of imports and his restoration of a balanced budget in august 1985 buhari was also overthrown with the army chief of staff ibrahim babangida taking power obasanjo was critical of some of the economic reforms that babangida introduced including the devaluation of the naira by 1992 his opposition to babangidas rule had led him to call for a redemocratisation of nigeria he also began to reject the economic indigenisation policies of the 1970s arguing that the constitution should prohibit the confiscation of foreign investments instead he thought the government should emphasise privateled development he became increasingly concerned by rapid population growth a topic he had ignored while in power urging nigerians to have smaller families in their own economic and national socioeconomic interest\\nduring the eleven years after obasanjo left office he published four books in 1980 obasanjo was a distinguished fellow at the university of ibadan where he wrote my command an account of his experiences during the civil war it was published in november that year some readers criticised what they saw as obasanjos disloyalty to murtala muhammed while robert adeyinka adebayo a senior yoruba political figure urged for the book to be withdrawn to prevent it sowing division a more positive assessment was made by his friend ken sarowiwa who called it masterly but believed that it had involved much editorial assistance in 1987 he published nzeogwu a memoir of his friend chukwuma nzeogwu with whom he had served in the congo 1989 saw the publication of obasanjos next book constitution for national integration and development in which he warned against babangidas argument for instituting a twoparty system in nigeria in 1990 his third book not my will was published it provided an account of his time governing the country\\ninternational activities19791993\\nseeking to retain influence on the global stage obasanjo launched the africa leadership forum from his ota farm from 1981 to 1982 he also sat on the palme commission a group chaired by the former swedish prime minister olof palme which discussed disarmament and international security obasanjo followed this with membership on similar panels for the united nations the world health organization and the interaction council of former heads of government when javier prez de cullar the un secretarygeneral fell ill obasanjo was considered as a potential successor after prez de cullar announced his resignation obasanjo began campaigning to replace him at a vote of the un security council he came third with egypts boutros boutrosghali taking on the role he left his home on several visits in 1986 he visited japan and in 1987 the us\\namid a dispute in the commonwealth of nations over the uks more lenient view of south africa it was agreed that an eminent persons group epg would be formed to initiate dialogue with the south african government in the hope of encouraging it toward dismantling apartheid at the recommendation of nigerias deputy secretarygeneral of the commonwealth emeka anyaoku obasanjo was nominated to cochair the group alongside former australian prime minister malcolm fraser obasanjo reluctantly agreed in february 1986 he and fraser travelled to cape town where they asked to meet with the imprisoned antiapartheid activist nelson mandela a prominent member of the banned african national congress anc obasanjo alone was permitted to meet with mandela he later commented that he was greatly impressed by him obasanjo then met with senior anc figures in exile in lusaka \\nin march 1986 the entirety of the epg visited south africa during a period of growing domestic unrest and violence there they met with senior government figures including prime minister p w botha whom obasanjo later described as the most intolerant man he had ever met the epgs report stated that while a majority of south africans desired a nonviolent negotiated settlement between the government and antiapartheid groups the former was unwilling to contemplate this and had made no significant progress towards ending apartheid the epg thus proposed that further international pressure was necessary a commonwealth committee accepted the reports findings with the uk dissenting this left obasanjo further frustrated with thatcher the commonwealth then commissioned him to head a committee to determine what the frontline states needed to defend themselves from south african incursions\\nafter botha was replaced by f w de klerk the latter freed mandela from prison one of mandelas first foreign trips was to nigeria where he visited obasanjo at his home two months later obasanjo led a nigerian

training for politicians from across the continent it began holding meetings known as the farm house dialogues from obasanjos home about six times a year it also held quarterly international meetings and issued a quarterly magazine africa forum between 1991 and 1993\\nopposing abacha 19921995\\nobasanjo voiced concern that despite his professed claims to support a return to democracy babangida had no intention of stepping down as military head of state after the presidential primaries were cancelled in 1992 obasanjo and anthony enahoro launched the association for democracy and good governance in nigeria the groups inaugural meeting brought together 31 domestic political figures at ota in may 1993 an election followed in june 1993 which saw low turnout moshood abiola of the social democratic party sdp claimed victory but this was challenged in court babangida then annulled the election result promising a second election soon after the sdp opposed any second election as they argued that their candidate had already won the first babangida then agreed to step down in favour of an interim civilian government led by ernest shonekan which took power in august 1993 and set out plans for new elections in february 1994 \\nmeanwhile sani abacha consolidated his control of the military and in november 1993 pressured shonekan into resigning allowing himself to take power obasanjo had telephoned abacha prior to the coup urging him not to take this course of action after abacha had seized power he asked obasanjo to meet with him the latter did but refused to support abachas government until it announced a date for its own departure abacha then abolished the existing political parties and democratic institutions and called for politicians from various backgrounds to join his federal executive council obasanjo refused to nominate anyone for this council\\nobasanjo began warning that nigeria was headed towards another civil war along ethnic divisions and in may 1994 he and yaradua launched the national unity promoters a group dedicated to preventing this outcome in june abiola unilaterally declared himself nigerias president and was arrested for treason although obasanjo refused to endorse abiolas claim he did advise abacha not to arrest him he then led a group of traditional leaders at a meeting in which they attempted to initiate a dialogue between abacha and abiola his refusal to support abiola angered many yoruba and obasanjos property in yorubaland was attacked obasanjo was upset by what he saw as punishment for not backing yoruba sectarian interests \\nin march 1995 obasanjo was in denmark for a un summit on social development in copenhagen while there he heard that yaradua had been detained and that he would probably face the same fate if he returned to nigeria he nevertheless argued that he had done nothing wrong and thus agreed to return once at lagos airport his passport was confiscated and the next day police picked him up from his ota home the police accused obasanjo of links to a coup against abacha being plotted by brigadier general lawan guadabe obasanjo was moved between various detention centres while former us president carter personally contacted abacha requesting obasanjos release obasanjo was then returned to ota where he was placed under house arrest for two months during which time he was denied access to media the telephone or visitors\\nanother of those accused of being involved in the plot colonel bellofadile a military lawyer had been tortured during which he signed a statement that he had gone to ota to inform obasanjo about the coup as it was in preparation this was used as evidence to charge obasanjo with concealment of treason a capital offense under nigerian law he was then taken to the state security interrogation centre at ikoyi abacha insisted that obasanjo be tried before a military court which took place on 19 june 1995 at the trial obasanjo denied that bellofadile had ever met with him bellofadile also maintained that he had signed the statement implicating obasanjo under duress but the court rejected this retraction\\non 14 july the court sentenced obasanjo to 25 years in prison yaradua and fourteen others also accused of being part of the conspiracy were sentenced to death obasanjo later called it his saddest day after the us president bill clinton stated that his country would embargo nigerian oil if these executions took place abacha commuted their sentences to imprisonment and reduced obasanjos sentence to 15 years\\nimprisonment 19951998\\nobasanjo spent the next four months at the ikoyi centre where he was initially chained up in solitary confinement he was then transferred to lagos main prison kirikiri where he spent time in the prison hospital for his hypertension and diabetes conditions in kirikiri were overcrowded and unsanitary with obasanjo stating that he would not wish it on my worst enemy there bellofadile apologised to obasanjo for having implicated him at which obasanjo forgave him a note written by bellofadile explaining the situation was then smuggled out of the prison and published helping to demonstrate obasanjos innocence \\nafter several weeks obasanjo and the other alleged conspirators were moved to jos prison in the central plateauplateau state where they spent several months obasanjo was initially given only the bible and quran to read but gradually allowed a wider range of literature writing material was also granted to him allowing him to correspond with various people and institutions and eventually stella was permitted to visit him once a month both mandela and pope john paul ii called for his release with indian and german foundations both awarding him international prizes the africa leadership forum produced two volumes of letters and essays written in his honour the forum itself had been forced to relocate to accra in ghana to avoid persecution from abachas government\\nin early 1996 obasanjo was moved from jos to the more remote prison at yolaadamawa state there he was allowed to cultivate a garden obasanjo related that in prison he deepened his christian faith and grew closer to god becoming a bornagain christian from that point christianity played a much larger role in his personal worldview at yola he preached 28 weekly sermons after visiting ministers were temporarily banned he wrote these sermons down allowing them to be published when he was released obasanjo also tried to reform some of the younger prisoners following up on their progress once he became a free man obasanjo feared that he would be poisoned particularly amid public speculation that yaraduas death had been caused by deliberate poisoning\\nabacha died suddenly in june 1998 after which the military commanders appointed lieutenant general abdulsalami abubakar as his successor a week later abubakar ordered obasanjos release sending a plane to return him to ota eager to return nigeria to civilian rule abubakar dissolved the countrys existing parties and institutions and announced a plan that would lead to a civilian president being installed in may 1999\\ncampaigning for the presidency 19981999\\nnow a free man obasanjo travelled to south africa the united kingdom and the united states where he underwent medical treatment new political parties were forming across nigeria one of the largest of which was the peoples democratic party pdp an umbrella group that sought to be sufficiently broad that if in power it would deter future coups prominent pdp members proposed obasanjo as an ideal presidential candidate they felt that he could command international respect and that as a military figure he could hold the country together against future coups and secessionist movements they also argued that nigeria needed a southern president to balance out its previous northern leadership and that obasanjo had proved himself as a southerner who had no partisan prejudice against the north \\nfriends and family urged him not to run saying that he would damage his good reputation or be killed obasanjo appeared reluctant but on 28 october he joined the pdp and a week later announced that he was putting himself forward to be the partys presidential nominee in his campaign he emphasized his desire to restore what he deemed the legacy of good governance when he left office in 1979 at a fundraising dinner he gained n356 million of which n120 million had been donated by industrialist aliko dangote most of these donations came from military men and the new business class he toured the country giving speeches and seeking audiences with influential persons courting state governors was a significant element of his approach his campaign overshadowed that of his main rival alex ekwueme who was widely mistrusted by northerners and the military\\nthe pdp was gaining ground in nigeria proving the most successful party in the local government elections of december 1998 the state elections in january 1999 and the senate and house of representatives elections in february 1999 on 14 february 1999 a pdp convention was called to select its presidential candidate obasanjo received 1658 votes to 521 for ekwueme and 260 for the other five candidates seeking a northerner as the pdps vice presidential candidate obasanjo selected atiku abubakar the presidential election took place on 27 february obasanjos sole opponent was the apps olu falae about a quarter of those eligible to vote did so and there was some rigging although no violence the official tally gave obasanjo 63 percent of the vote he was the loser in all six states of his native yorubaland\\npresidency 19992007\\nfirst term\\nafter having it exorcised obasanjo moved into the presidential complex at aso rock in may on 29 may he took the presidential oath in abujas eagle square while appointing his new government he selected an even number of ministers from the north and south of nigeria although the fact that a majority were christian upset some muslim northerners critics generally characterised obasanjos cabinet as being too old and conservative as well as lacking in experience especially when dealing with economic matters during his first administration the levels of freedom experienced by nigerians increased freedom of the press allowed for considerable criticism of the president\\nin the initial months of his presidency obasanjo retired around 200 military officers including all 93 who held political positions thus making a coup by experienced officers less likely he also moved the defence ministry from lagos to abuja ensuring it was brought under more direct government control\\nsecond term\\nobasanjo was reelected in a tumultuous 2003 election that had violent ethnic and religious overtones his main opponent fellow former military ruler general muhammadu buhari was muslim and drew his support mainly from the north capturing 618 of the vote obasanjo defeated buhari by more than 11\\xa0million votes\\nin november 2003 obasanjo was criticized for his decision to grant asylum to the deposed liberian president charles taylor on 12 june 2006 he signed the greentree agreement with cameroonian president paul biya which formally put an end to the bakassi peninsula border dispute even though the nigerian senate passed a resolution declaring that the withdrawal of nigerian troops from the bakassi peninsula was illegal obasanjo gave the order for it to continue as planned \\nin his second term obasanjo continued to ensure the expansion of the countrys police force which rose to 325000 in 2007\\nongoing rural violence between muslims and christians in plateau state led obasanjo to declare a state of emergency there in may 2004 suspending the state government and installing six months of military rule on 22 august 2005 the then governor of abia state orji uzor kalu submitted a petition alleging corrupt practices against obasanjo to the efcc\\nthird term agenda\\nobasanjo was embroiled in controversy regarding his third term agenda a plan to modify the constitution so he could serve a third fouryear term as president this led to a political media uproar in nigeria and the bill was not ratified by the national assembly consequently obasanjo stepped down after the april 2007 general election in an exclusive interview granted to channels television obasanjo denied involvement in what has been defined as third term agenda he said that it was the national assembly nigeria that included tenure elongation amongst the other clauses of the constitution of nigeria that were to be amended i never toyed with the idea of a third term obasanjo said\\nobasanjo was condemned by major political players during the third term agenda saga senator ken nnamani former president of the nigerian senate claimed obasanjo informed him about the agenda shortly after he became president of the nigerian senate immediately i became senate president he told me of his intentions and told me how he wanted to achieve it i initially did not take him seriously until the events began to unfold he also insinuated that eight billion naira was spent to corrupt legislators to support the agenda how can someone talk like this that he didnt know about it yet money both in local and foreign currencies exchanged hands he asked femi gbajabiamila corroborated nnamanis account but put the figure differently the money totaled over n10 billion how could n10bn be taken out of the national treasury for a project when you were the sitting president yet that project was not your idea where did the money come from in the following quotes nnamani said president george w bush warned obasanjo to desist from his plan to contest presidential election for the third term if you want to be convinced that the man is only telling a lie pick up a copy of the book written by condoleza rice the former secretary to the government of the united states of america it is actually an autobiography by rice on page 628 or page 638 she discussed obasanjos meeting with bush how he told the former american president that he wanted to see how he could amend the constitution so that he could go for a third term to his surprise bush told him not to try it bush told him to be patriotic and leave by may 29 2007\\neconomic social and foreign policies\\neconomic policy\\nwith the oil revenue obasanjo created the niger delta development commission and implemented the universal basic education program to enhance the literacy level of nigerians he constituted both the independent corrupt practices commission and the economic and financial crimes commission resuscitated the national fertilizer company in kaduna and onne port harcourt obasanjo increased the share of oil royalties and rents to the state of origin from 3 to 13 percent\\nbefore obasanjos administration nigerias gdp growth had been painfully slow since 1987 and only managed 3 percent between 19992000 however under obasanjo the growth rate doubled to 6 percent until he left office helped in part by higher oil prices nigerias foreign reserves rose from 2\\xa0billion in 1999 to 43\\xa0billion on leaving office in 2007 \\nhe was able to secure debt pardons from the paris and london club amounting to some 18\\xa0billion and paid another 18\\xa0billion to be debt free most of these loans were accumulated from shortterm trade arrears during the exchange control period point of correction most of these loans were accumulated not out of corruption but during a period 19821985 when nigeria operated exchange control regime that vested all foreign exchange transactions on the central bank of nigeria \\nwhen obasanjo took office nigerias economy was in a poor state inflation had averaged about 30 a year throughout the 1990s and by 2001 around 20 of nigerian adults were unemployed poverty was widespread with obasanjos government seeking to alleviate this by paying n3500 a month to around 200000 people to conduct routine tasks such as sweeping and mending roads this project was then replaced with a national poverty eradication programme which focused on generating youth employment rural infrastructure and conservation in 2000 obasanjos government doubled the legal minimum wage \\nhe invited the international monetary fund imf to review nigerias economy and offer advice on how to improve it they warned that the government was overspending in 2001 obasanjo declared himself a believer in market efficiency and related that he had seen the damage caused by public sector mismanagement first hand however while expressing his commitment to the washington consensus of free markets privatisation and limited state expenditure government expenditure as a share of gdp rose from 29 in 1997 to 50 in 2001 in january 2000 nigeria received a us1 billion standby loan which allowed the government to enter debt rescheduling negotiations with its creditors obasanjos government benefited from high international oil prices during his first presidential term it planned both to increase nigerias oil output and to produce increasing quantities of liquefied natural gas which was first exported from the country in 1999\\nobasanjo was determined to abolish the petrol subsidy increasing prices to commercial rates the nigerian labour congress called a general strike in protest for june 2000 and obasanjo ultimately compromised reducing the subsidy rather than abolishing it this situation allowed obasanjo to be portrayed as an enemy of the poor on the public imagination to further reduce expenditure obasanjo turned to privatisation forming a national council on privatisation in july 1999 when he took office nigerias federal government owned 588 public enterprises accounting for over 55 of external debt and obasanjo hoped that many of these although not those involved in oil production could be sold off privatisation was not popular with nigerias population having only 35 support according to a 2000 opinion survey obasanjo was also keen to negotiate debt reduction he insisted that nigerias debts were so large as to be unpayable and that they threatened its economy and democracy although canada italy and the us cancelled nigerias debts these were small and the countrys major creditors the largest of which was the uk refused\\nobasanjo blamed many of nigerias economic problems on endemic corruption in 2000 transparency international ranked it the worlds most corrupt country several days after taking office he presented an anticorruption bill to the national assembly although this aroused much opposition from critics who thought it gave the government excessive powers compromises were reached that watereddown obasanjos proposals allowing him to sign the new law in june 2000 there is no evidence that corruption declined in nigeria in obasanjos first term and his government did nothing to check nigerias endemic lowlevel corruption which was widespread at the state and local government levels \\npublic health was also a key issue in nigeria during the 1990s nigeria had spent about 02 of its gdp on public health services the joint lowest percentage in the world obasanjos government increased this to over 04 the most urgent health crisis impacting nigeria was the hivaids epidemic with obasanjo immediately ordering a situation report on the topic after taking office he then established a presidential committee on aids which he headed as chair and created a national action plan committee to prepare a campaign for 200003 which would focus on publicity training counselling and testing to combat the virus to advance public health more broadly he launched a new primary care campaign that used local government funds to try and build a clinic in every one of nigerias 774 local government areas\\nforeign policy\\none of obasanjos major tasks in which he succeeded was to improve nigerias international reputation which had been tarnished under abacha he spent over a quarter of his first term abroad having visited 92 countries by october 2002 in october 1999 obasanjo launched a south africannigerian binational commission to discuss cooperation between the two countries the largest powers on subsaharan africa obasanjo retained nigerias close ties with the us bringing in us advisers to help train the nigerian military he had close ties with us president bill clinton and also got on with clintons successor george w bush bush visited abuja in 2000 and obasanjo visited washington dc in 2006 pursuing warmer relations with the uk than he had in the 1970s he attended his first commonwealth conference in november 1999 and hosted that in december 2003 where he received an honorary knighthood from british queen elizabeth ii\\non taking office obasanjo had vowed to withdraw nigerian troops from sierra leone in august 1999 he announced a schedule for their withdrawal although this was suspended while a un peacekeeping force was assembled to which nigeria provided 4000 troops this force withdrew in 2005 amid turmoil in liberia obasanjo ordered nigerian troops into the country in august 2003 they passed into a un command two months later obasanjo granted liberias ousted leader charles taylor refuge in nigeria although subsequently returned him to liberia to face trial for war crimes at the request of new liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf eager to keep nigeria out of domestically unpopular conflicts he refused requests for the nigerian military to participate in an ecomog intervention in the guineabissau civil war and the 2002 peacekeeping mission to the cote divoire at the uks request he assisted in a mediation with robert mugabes zimbabwe government over the latters encouragement of the violent seizure of whiteowned farms along with south african president thabo mbeki and australian prime minister john howard he was part of a team tasked with dealing with zimbabwe by the commonwealth obasanjo and mbeki visited zimbabwe three times to work on quiet diplomacy unsuccessfully urging mugabe to either retire or form a power sharing government with the opposition movement for democratic change\\nconfronting ethnic and religious tensions\\nshortly after obasanjos election the place of islamic sharia law became a major debate in nigerian politics since the countrys independence sharia had been restricted to civil cases between muslims in the northern states criminal cases were not governed by sharia law something that offended some muslims in september 1999 the governor of zamfara state ahmed sani announced the full introduction of sharia as the basis of that states penal code although specified that it would only apply to muslim residents and not the nonislamic minority this sparked alarm among christian minorities across northern nigeria with protests and counterprotests generating violence especially in kaduna across nigeria christian opinion was very hostile to the introduction of sharia as the basis of state penal systems both houses of the national assembly urged obasanjo to take the issue to the supreme court he was eager to avoid this not wanting the role of sharia to become a constitutional issue publicly he sought to distinguish what he called genuine sharia from political sharia praising the former while insisting that the latter was a fad that would fizzle out by refusing to intervene obasanjo drew criticism for a lack of courage from many southerners while muslim hardliners in the north mocked him amid popular demand from muslim communities four more northern states adopted sharia penal law in 2000 and seven more in 2001 obasanjo later stated that the issue was the biggest challenge he ever faced as presidentwhen obasanjo came to power he was appalled that nigeria was experiencing widespread unrest and violence resulting in thousands of deaths this violence was being exacerbated by a rapidly growing population which brought with it spiralling urbanisation and competition for scarce land in rural areas to deal with this obasanjo doubled the countrys police force from 120000 to 240000 between 1999 and 2003 little was done to deal with police brutality with the torture of suspects remaining widespread under obasanjos administration also fuelling the violence were ethnic tensions with different ethnic and regional groups calling for greater autonomy leading various commentators to predict the breakup of nigeria for obasanjo keeping the country united became a major priority only on select occasions would he turn to the military to quell unrest preferring not to have to mobilise the army unless state governors requested it in his words we must utilise military force only when all else has failed that is my own principle and philosophy he saw greater value in forgiveness amnesty and reconciliation to achieve harmony than in retributive criminal justice of perpetrators under obasanjos presidency the levels of violence and disorder in nigeria declined\\na major hub of secessionist sentiment was in the niger delta region where indigenous groups wanted to retain a far greater proportion of the proceeds from the areas lucrative oil reserves in july 1999 obasanjo sent the national assembly a bill to create a niger delta development commission to formulate and implement a plan for dealing with the region something he hoped would quell violence there amid much debate the commission was finally launched in december 2000 in november 1999 he also sent two army battalions into the niger delta region to apprehend the asawana boys an ijaw group who had captured and killed police officers in odi bayelsa state the military destroyed most of the town the government claimed that 43 had been killed but a local ngo put the number of civilian deaths at 2483 obasanjo described the destruction as avoidable and regrettable and visited odi in march 2001 he refused to condemn the army apologise for the destruction pay compensation or rebuild the town although the niger delta development commission did the latter \\nin 2000 obasanjo banned the oodua peoples congress opc a yoruba nationalist group involved in violence against other ethnicities and ordered the arrest of its leaders in september 2001 violence between indigenous christians and northern muslim traders in plateau state resulted in around 500 deaths before the army moved in and regained control obasanjo then visited and urged reconciliation in october 2001 muslim demonstrators in kano killed around 200 igbo in response to nigerias support for the us bombing of afghanistan obasanjo then visited to urge reconciliation but was booed by residents also in october soldiers had been sent to calm tensions between the jukun and tiv communities along the borders between benue and taraba states a tiv militia then captured and killed them in zakibiam obasanjo ordered the army in where they rounded up and killed as many as 250 to 300 local men obasanjo visited the area in 2002 and apologised for the excessive use of force\\nin january 2002 obasanjo ordered the mobile police to breakup the bakossi boys a vigilante group active primarily in abia and anambra states which was responsible for an estimated two thousand killings he had hesitated doing so before due to the popular support that the group had accrued through fighting criminal gangs but felt able to move against them after their popularity waned that same month an ammunition dump at the ijeka barracks near lagos exploded potentially resulting in as many as a thousand deaths obasanjo visited immediately violent unrest had also continued in lagos and in february 2002 troops were sent into the city to restore stability in april 2002 obasanjo proposed legislation that would allow for the proscription of ethnicbased groups if they were deemed to promote violence but the national executive rejected this as an overreach of presidential power\\nsome public officials like the speaker of the house of representatives and president of the senate were involved in conflicts with the president who battled many impeachment attempts from both houses obasanjo managed to survive impeachment and was renominated\\npostpresidency 2007present\\npolitics\\nhe became chairman of the pdp

grab the wheel if nigeria goes off course he voluntarily resigned as the chairman board of trustees of the pdp in april 2012 afterwards he withdrew from political activities with pdp\\nin march 2008 obasanjo was supposedly indicted by a committee of the nigerian parliament for awarding 22bnworth of energy contracts during his eightyear rule without due process the report of this probe was never accepted by the whole nigerian parliament due to manipulation of the entire process by the leadership of the power probe committee it is not on any official record that chief obasanjo was indicted\\nin may 2014 obasanjo wrote to president goodluck jonathan requesting that he should mediate on behalf of the nigerian government for the release of the chibok girls held by the boko haram militants\\non 16 february 2015 he quit the ruling party and directed a pdp ward leader to tear his membership card during a press conference he was later to be known as the navigator of the newly

to the wartorn democratic republic of the congo he held separate meetings with drc president joseph kabila and rebel leader laurent nkunda\\nduring the zimbabwean election of july 2013 obasanjo headed a delegation of african union election observers\\nfurther education\\nin december 2017 obasanjo defended his phd thesis at the national open university of nigeria noun he now holds a phd in theology that was about two years after he completed his masters degree in the same course\\npolitical ideology\\nideologically obasanjo was a nigerian nationalist he was committed to a form of nigerian patriotism and the belief that nigeria should be retained as a single nationstate rather than being broken up along ethnic lines in 2001 he stated that his longterm goal was the nullification of all forms of identification except nigerian citizenship he argued that dismantling nigeria along ethnic lines would result in the ethnic cleansing and violence that had been seen during the yugoslav wars of the 1990s ilife argued that obasanjos nigerian nationalism was impacted both by his detachment from the yoruba elite and by his time in the army where he worked alongside soldiers from a broad range of ethnic backgrounds \\niliffe noted that an emphasis on consensus politics was a guiding principle throughout obasanjos career while in power during the 1970s obasanjo expressed criticism of institutionalized opposition to the government in his view this was profoundly incongruent with most african political culture and practice instead of constantly opposing the government he believed that opposition parties should instead offer constructive criticism and that politicians should pursue a search for consensus rather than engaging in constant competition he thought that political competition had a destabilising effect that was particularly dangerous for a developing country such as nigeria and that stability should be preserved\\nfrustrated with what he regarded as the failures of representative democratic rule during the early 1980s obasanjo began expressing support for a oneparty state in nigeria he nevertheless insisted that this oneparty state must facilitate general public participation in governance respect human rights and protect freedom of expression later in the 1980s he warned against the proposed twoparty state which babangida was putting forward believing that while babangida envisioned a centreleft and centreright party competing against each other it would inevitably develop into one party representing the christian south and the other representing the muslim north he instead argued that there should be no limit on the number of political parties that could be formed although suggested that if this could not occur then nigeria should become a oneparty state amid the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s and the subsequent move towards multiparty politics across africa obasanjo again became supportive of multiparty systems\\niliffe noted that as a politician obasanjo displayed an openminded pragmatism a tactic employed by obasanjo at various points was to deliberately polarise an issue so as to rally support for his perspective\\niliffe thought that although obasanjo had been too young to play a major role in the anticolonialist struggle for nigerian independence from british rule he was marked for ever by the optimism and dedication of the independence movement\\nin office obasanjos task was to ensure that nigeria functioned both politically and economically over the course of his political career obasanjo moved from the belief in the advantages of state involvement in heavy industry which was common in the 1970s to a commitment to market liberalism that had become dominant in the 1990s iliffe thought that throughout his career obasanjo had always displayed an ambivalence about the level of state involvement in the economy his general attitude was that poverty was caused by idleness while campaigning for the 1999 presidential election obasanjo called himself a marketoriented social democrat although was vague on his proposed economic strategy during his presidency his government brought together figures who were committed to free markets who favoured more protectionist economic strategies and those sympathetic to socialism obasanjo was contemptuous of ideological arguments about capitalism and socialism the decisions he took were usually based on political considerations rather than on legal or constitutional principles something which was a source of concern for some of his critics erfler thought that during his first term in office obasanjo was a cautious reformer\\npersonal life\\nobasanjo lived a polygamous lifestyle obasanjo married his first wife oluremi akinlawon in london in 1963 she gave birth to his first child iyabo in 1967 iyabo had a close relationship with her father oluremi was unhappy that obasanjo maintained relationships with other women and alleged that he beat her they divorced in the mid 1970s that decade obasanjo began a commonlaw relationship with nta reporter gold oruh who bore him two children he married his second wife stella abebe in 1976 having met her on a visit to london he married stella in 1976 and she bore him three children obasanjos other partners include businesswoman lynda soares who was murdered by car thieves in 1986 on 23 october 2005 the president lost his wife stella obasanjo first lady of nigeria the day after she had an abdominoplasty in spain in 2009 the doctor known only as am was sentenced to one year in jail for negligence in spain and ordered to pay restitution to her son of about 176000 he was largely private about his relationships with these women some of his children were resentful that he gave them no special privileges and treated their mothers poorly\\nethnically obasanjo is yoruba a cultural identification he reflected in his speech and choice of clothing however he always foregrounded his nigerian identity above his yoruba one repeatedly stating that i am a nigerian who happens to be a yoruba man i am not a yoruba man who happens to be a nigerian\\nthroughout his life he expressed a preference for rural over urban life he has been a lifelong teetotaller he has been characterised as having a sense of discipline and duty and emphasised what he saw as the importance of leadership he was meticulous at planning and iliffe called him an instinctively cautious man obasanjo always emphasised the importance of deferring to seniority a value he had learned in childhood\\niliffe described obasanjo as a man with great physical and intellectual energy who exercised power with skill and ruthlessness sometimes unscrupulously but seldom cruelly erfler similarly stated that although obasanjo could appear boorish and dull he had a sharply perceptive mind and the capacity to be tough and ruthless he had according to iliffe a remarkable capacity for work he was cautious with money living modestly and seeking financial security by investing in property he is softlyspoken\\nin his sixties obasanjo would regularly work 18 to 20 hour days getting very little sleep he would start each day with prayers obasanjo suffers from diabetes and high bloodpressure he enjoyed playing squash\\nobasanjos writings after his imprisonment reflected his commitment to

bank to jordan and in 1975 demanding that the palestinian arabs receive a just settlement of their grievances in 1977 helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting american companies from

presidential election\\nhelms supported ronald reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976 even before reagan had announced his candidacy his contribution was crucial in the north carolina primary victory that paved the way for reagans presidential election in 1980 the support of helms alongside raleighbased campaign operative thomas f ellis was instrumental in reagans winning the north carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent president gerald ford at the 1976 republican national convention according to author craig shirley the two men deserve credit for breathing life into the dying reagan campaign going into the primary reagan had lost all the primaries including in new hampshire where he had been favored and was two million dollars in debt with a growing number of republican leaders calling for his exit the ford campaign was predicting a victory in north carolina but assessed reagans strength in the state simply helmss support while ford had the backing of governor james holshouser the grassroots movement formed in north carolina by ellis and backed by helms delivered an upset victory by 53 to 47 the momentum generated in north carolina carried ronald reagan to landslide primary wins in texas california and other critical states evening the contest between reagan and ford and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention\\nlater helms was not pleased by the announcement that reagan if nominated would ask the 1976 republican national convention to make moderate pennsylvania senator richard schweiker his running mate for the general election but kept his objections to himself at the time according to helms after reagan told him of the decision helms noted the hour because i wanted to record for posterity the exact time i received the shock of my life helms and strom thurmond tried to make reagan drop schweiker for a conservative perhaps either james buckley or his brother william f buckley jr and rumors surfaced that helms might run for vice president himself but schweiker was kept in the end reagan lost narrowly to ford at the convention while helms received only token support for the vice presidential nomination albeit enough to place him second far behind fords choice of bob dole the convention adopted a broadly conservative platform and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners except jesse helms\\nhelms vowed to campaign actively for ford across the south regarding the conservative platform adopted at the convention to be a mandate on which ford was pledging to run however he targeted henry kissinger after the latter issued a statement calling aleksandr solzhenitsyn a threat to world peace and helms demanded that kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately helms continued to back reagan and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout reagans political career although sometimes critical of each other despite reagans defeat at the convention the intervention of helms and ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the republican party this victory enabled reagan to contest the 1976 republican presidential nomination and to win the next nomination at the 1980 republican national convention and ultimately the presidency of the united states\\naccording to craig shirley\\nhad reagan lost north carolina despite his public pronouncements his revolutionary challenge to ford along with his political career would have ended unceremoniously he would have made a gracious exit speech cut a deal with the ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt made a minor speech at the kansas city convention later that year and returned to his ranch in santa barbara he would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income and reagan would have faded into political oblivion\\ntorrijoscarter treaties\\nhelms was a longtime opponent of transferring possession of the panama canal to panama calling its construction an historic american achievement he warned that it would fall into the hands of omar torrijoss communist friends the issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race wherein thenpresident ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition in 1977 president jimmy carter reopened negotiations appointing sol linowitz as conegotiator without senate confirmation and helms and strom thurmond led the opposition to the transfer helms claimed that linowitzs involvement with marine midland constituted a conflict of interests arguing that it constituted a bailout of american banking interests he filed two federal suits

as his conservative base was concerned\\nwhen carter announced on august 10 1977 the conclusion of the treaties helms declared it a constitutional crisis cited the need for the support of united states allies in latin america accused the us of submitting to panamanian blackmail and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in europe helms threatened to

the ratification vote came in the runup to the election helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78 public opposition however helmss and thurmonds leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for carter causing them to be replaced by the softspoken paul laxalt\\n1978 reelection campaign\\nhelms began campaigning for reelection in february 1977 giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries while he faced no primary opponent the democrats nominated commissioner of insurance john ingram who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the runoff

special interests in which he included helms helms was one of three senators given a 100 rating by the conservative americans for constitutional action for 1977 and was ranked fourthmost conservative by others the democratic national committee targeted helms as did president carter who visited north carolina twice on ingrams behalf\\nin june 1978 along with strom thurmond helms was one of two

the long campaign helms raised 75 million more than twice as much as the second mostexpensive nationwide john towers in texas thanks to richard vigueries and alex castellanoss pioneering direct mail

out\\nhelms also criticized the government over zimbabwe rhodesia leading support for the internal settlement government under abel muzorewa and campaigned along with samuel hayakawa for the immediate lifting of sanctions on muzorewas government helms complained that it was inconsistent to lift sanctions on uganda immediately after idi amins departure but not zimbabwe rhodesia after ian smiths helms hosted muzorewa when he visited washington and met with carter in july 1979 he sent two aides to the lancaster house conference because he did not trust the state department on this issue thereby provoking british diplomatic complaints his aide john carbaugh was accused of encouraging smith to hang on and take a harder line implying that there was enough support in the us senate to lift sanctions without a settlement helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions as negotiations progressed helms complied more with the administrations line although senator ted kennedy accused carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for helmss acquiescence on zimbabwe rhodesia which both parties denied helmss support for lifting sanctions on zimbabwe rhodesia may have been grounded in north carolinas tobacco traders who would have been the main group benefiting from unilaterally lifting sanctions on tobaccoexporting zimbabwe rhodesia\\n1980 presidential election\\nin 1979 helms was touted as a potential contender for the republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election but had poor voter recognition and he lagged far behind the frontrunners he was the only candidate to file for the new hampshire vicepresidential primary going into 1980 he was suggested as a potential running mate for reagan and said hed accept if he could be his own man he was one of three conservative candidates running for the nomination however his ideological agreement with reagan risked losing moderates votes particularly due to the independent candidacy of rep john b anderson and the reagan camp was split eventually designating george h w bush as his preferred candidate at the convention helms toyed with the idea of running for vicepresident despite reagans choice but let it go in exchange for bushs endorsing the party platform and allowing helms to address the convention as expected helms was drafted by conservatives anyway and won 54 votes coming second helms was the spiritual leader of the conservative convention and led the movement that successfully reversed the republican partys 36year platform support for an equal rights amendment\\nin the fall of 1980 helms proposed another bill denying the supreme court jurisdiction over school prayer but this found little support in committee it was strongly opposed by mainline protestant churches and its counterpart was defeated in the house senators helms and james a mcclure blocked ted kennedys comprehensive criminal code that did not relax federal firearms restrictions inserted capital punishment procedures and reinstated current statutory law on pornography prostitution and drug possession following from his success at reintroducing goldindexed

election helms and strom thurmond sponsored a senate amendment to a department of justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing due to objections over federal

wheels winning the other north carolina seat howard baker was set to become majority leader but conservatives angered by bakers support for the panama treaty salt ii and the equal rights amendment had sought to replace him with helms until reagan gave baker his backing although it was thought theyd put helms in charge of the foreign relations committee instead of the liberal charles h percy he instead became chairman of the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee in the new congress\\nthe first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous foreign relations committee confirmation hearings which were held up by helms who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with kissinger and not dedicated enough to his definition of the reagan program

eagleburger all of whom were confirmed regardless while all of helmss candidates were rejected helms also unsuccessfully opposed the nominations of caspar weinberger donald regan and frank carlucci however he did score a notable coup two years later when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of robert t grey for nine months and thus causing the firing of eugene v rostow\\nfood stamp program\\nan opponent of the food stamp program helms had already voted to reduce its scope and was determined to follow this through as agriculture committee chairman at one point he proposed a 40 cut in their funding instead helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare he then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by 1150 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program he maintained that free lunches duplicate food stamps the outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program he said that the public had grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed\\nas a freshman lawmaker in 1973 helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps though he failed to gain reversal his position drew the support of future minority and majority leader howard baker of tennessee and twelve senate democrats helmss position was upheld in 1988 when the united states supreme court decreed 53 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps before going on strike justice byron white said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers\\nas the agriculture committee chairman helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps with that position he ran afoul of fellow republican bob dole who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program helms cited a congressional budget office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped when helmss ally steve symms of idaho proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement the motion was defeated 3366\\nthe helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits house and senate conferees dropped a helmsbacked provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly house democratic whip tom foley of washington insisted that such a penalty would violate the fifth amendment rights to due process instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits\\neconomic policies\\nhelms supported the gold standard through his role as the agriculture committee chairman which exercises wide powers over commodity markets during the budget crisis of 1981 helms restored 200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid and against increases in grain and milk price support despite the importance of the dairy industry to north carolina he warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman however in 1983 he used his position to lobby to use the countrys strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the european union helms heavily opposed cutting food aid to poland after martial law was declared and called for the end of grain exports to and arms limitation talks with the soviet union instead\\nin 1982 helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10 with a personal allowance of 2000 he voted against the 1983 budget the only conservative senator to have done so and was a leading voice for a balanced budget

the union he was the only sitting senator from a confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his states secession in 1862 lincoln appointed him as military governor of tennessee

infrastructure the constitution was submitted for a public vote and johnson spoke widely for its adoption the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure on january 4 1834 his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of greeneville\\nin 1835 johnson made a bid for election to the floater seat which greene county shared with neighboring washington county in the tennessee house of representatives according to his biographer hans l trefousse johnson demolished the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin during his greeneville days johnson joined the tennessee militia as a member of the 90th regiment he attained the rank of colonel though while an enrolled member johnson was fined for an unknown offense afterwards he was often addressed or referred to by his rank\\nin his first term in the legislature which met in the state capital of nashville johnson did not consistently vote with either the democratic or the newly formed whig party though he revered president andrew jackson a democrat and fellow tennessean the major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals with the party system in a state of flux the whig party had organized in opposition to jackson fearing the concentration of power in the executive branch of the government johnson differed from the whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation after brookins campbell and the whigs defeated johnson for reelection in 1837 johnson would not lose another race for thirty years in 1839 he sought to regain his seat initially as a whig but when another candidate sought the whig nomination he ran as a democrat and was elected from that time he supported the democratic party and built a powerful political machine in greene county johnson became a strong advocate of the democratic party noted for his oratory and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it people flocked to hear him\\nin 1840 johnson was selected as a presidential elector for tennessee giving him more statewide publicity although democratic president martin van buren was defeated by former ohio senator william henry harrison johnson was instrumental in keeping tennessee and greene county in the democratic column he was elected to the tennessee senate in 1841 where he served a twoyear term he had achieved financial success in his tailoring business but sold it to concentrate on politics he had also acquired additional real estate including a larger home and a farm where his mother and stepfather took residence and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves\\nunited states representative

majority in the house of representatives johnson advocated for the interests of the poor maintained an antiabolitionist stance argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs with eliza remaining in greeneville congressman johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the library of congress although a fellow tennessee democrat james k polk was elected president in 1844 and johnson had campaigned for him the two men had difficult relations and president polk refused some of his patronage suggestions\\njohnson believed as did many southern democrats that the constitution protected private property including slaves and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery he won a second term in 1845 against william g brownlow presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy in his second term johnson supported the polk administrations decision to fight the mexican war seen by some northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward and opposed the wilmot proviso a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from mexico he introduced for the first time his homestead bill to grant to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it this issue was especially important to johnson because of his own humble beginnings\\nin the presidential election of 1848 the democrats split over the slavery issue and abolitionists formed the free soil party with former president van buren as their nominee johnson supported the democratic candidate former michigan senator lewis cass with the party split whig nominee general zachary taylor was easily victorious and carried tennessee johnsons relations with polk remained poor the president recorded of his final new years reception in 1849 that\\njohnson due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district also supported government assistance for the east tennessee and virginia railroad\\nin his campaign for a fourth term johnson concentrated on three issues slavery homesteads and judicial elections he defeated his opponent nathaniel g taylor in august 1849 with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns when the house convened in december the party division caused by the free soil party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a speaker johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a speaker by a plurality some weeks later others took up a similar proposal and democrat howell cobb was elected\\nonce the speaker election had concluded and congress was ready to conduct legislative business the issue of slavery took center stage northerners sought to admit california a free state to the union kentuckys henry clay introduced in the senate a series of resolutions the compromise of 1850 to admit california and pass legislation sought by each side johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nations capital he pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators then elected by state legislatures and of the president chosen by the electoral college and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years these were all defeated\\na group of democrats nominated landon carter haynes to oppose johnson as he sought a fifth term the whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own the campaign included fierce debates johnsons main issue was the passage of the homestead bill haynes contended it would facilitate abolition johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes though he was not enamored of the partys presidential nominee in 1852 former new hampshire senator franklin pierce johnson campaigned for him pierce was elected but he failed to carry tennessee in 1852 johnson managed to get the house to pass his homestead bill but it failed in the senate the whigs had gained control of the tennessee legislature and under the leadership of gustavus henry redrew the boundaries of johnsons first district to make it a safe seat for their party the nashville union termed this henrymandering lamented johnson i have no political future\\ngovernor of tennessee 18531857\\nif johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek reelection he soon changed his mind his political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor the democratic convention unanimously named him though some party members were not happy at his selection the whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections and still controlled the legislature that party nominated henry making the henrymandering of the first district an immediate issue the two men debated in county seats the length of tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the august 1853 election due to illness in henrys family johnson won the election by 63413 votes to 61163 some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support whig nathaniel taylor for his old seat in congress\\ntennessees governor had little power johnson could propose legislation but not veto it and most appointments were made by the whigcontrolled legislature nevertheless the office was a bully pulpit that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views he succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of john bell a whig for one of the states us senate seats in his first biennial speech johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system abolition of the bank of tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures the last was passed johnson was critical of the tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes either statewide or county by countya mixture of the two was passed reforms carried out during johnsons time as governor included the foundation of the states public library making books available to all and its first public school system and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers\\nalthough the whig party was on its final decline nationally it remained strong in tennessee and the outlook for democrats there in 1855 was poor feeling that reelection as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought johnson agreed to make the run meredith p gentry received the whig nomination a series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued the issues in the campaign were slavery the prohibition of alcohol and the nativist positions of the know nothing party johnson favored the first but opposed the others gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question and had gained the support of the know nothings a group johnson portrayed as a secret society johnson was unexpectedly victorious albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853\\nwhen the presidential election of 1856 approached johnson hoped to be nominated some tennessee county conventions designated him a favorite son his position that the best interests of the union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president he was never a major contender the nomination fell to former pennsylvania senator james buchanan though he was not impressed by either johnson campaigned for buchanan and his running mate john c breckinridge who were elected\\njohnson decided not to seek a third term as

william b campbell wrote to his uncle the great anxiety of the whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat andrew johnson for senator should the democrats have the majority he will certainly be their choice and there is no man living to whom the americans and whigs have as much antipathy as johnson the governor spoke widely in the campaign and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature johnsons final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors and he made proposals popular among democrats two days later the legislature elected him to the senate the opposition was appalled with the richmond whig newspaper referring to him as the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the union\\njohnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and selfemployed tradesmen who made up much of tennessees electorate he called them the plebeians he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state democratic party but none could match him as a votegetter after his death one tennessee voter wrote of him johnson was always the same to everyone\\xa0 the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen always seen in impeccably tailored clothing he cut an impressive figure and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate mostly denied the partys machinery he relied on a network of friends advisers and contacts one friend hugh douglas stated in a letter to him you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time at heart many of us never wanted you to be governor only none of the rest of us could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you then we did not want you to go to the senate but the people would send you\\nthe new senator took his seat when congress convened in december 1857 the term of his predecessor james c jones had expired in march he came to washington as usual without his wife and family eliza would visit washington only once during johnsons first time as senator in 1860 johnson immediately set about introducing the homestead bill in the senate but as most senators who supported it were northern many associated with the newly founded republican party the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the homestead bill were more likely to be northern nonslaveholders the issue of slavery had been complicated by the supreme courts ruling earlier in the year in dred scott v sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories johnson a slaveholding senator from a southern state made a major speech in the senate the following may in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the homestead bill and slavery were not incompatible nevertheless southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation 3022 in 1859 it failed on a procedural vote when vice president breckinridge broke a tie against the bill and in 1860 a watereddown version passed both houses only to be vetoed by buchanan at the urging of southerners johnson continued his opposition to spending chairing a committee to control it\\nhe argued against funding to build infrastructure in washington dc stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the citys streets even if it was the seat of government he opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the mormons in utah territory arguing for temporary volunteers as the united states should not have a standing army\\nsecession crisis\\nin october 1859 abolitionist john brown and sympathizers raided the federal arsenal at harpers ferry virginia today west virginia tensions in washington between pro and antislavery forces increased greatly johnson gave a major speech in the senate in december decrying northerners who would endanger the union by seeking to outlaw slavery the tennessee senator stated that all men are created equal from the declaration of independence did not apply to african americans since the constitution of illinois contained that phraseand that document barred voting by african americans johnson by this time was a wealthy man who owned 14 slaves\\njohnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the democratic party tore itself apart over the slavery question busy with the homestead bill during the 1860 democratic national convention in charleston south carolina he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom dealmaking the convention deadlocked with no candidate able to gain the required twothirds vote but the sides were too far apart to consider johnson as a compromise the party split with northerners backing illinois senator stephen douglas while southerners including johnson supported vice president breckinridge for president with former tennessee senator john bell running a fourthparty candidacy and further dividing the vote the republican party elected its first president former illinois representative abraham lincoln the election of lincoln known to be against the spread of slavery was unacceptable to many in the south although secession from the union had not been an issue in the campaign talk of it began in the southern states\\njohnson took to the senate floor after the election giving a speech well received in the north i will not give up this government\\xa0 no i intend to stand by it\\xa0 and i invite every man who is a patriot to\\xa0 rally around the altar of our common country\\xa0 and swear by our god and all that is sacred and holy that the constitution shall be saved and the union preserved as southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded he reminded mississippi senator jefferson davis that if southerners would only hold to their seats the democrats would control the senate and could defend the souths interests against any infringement by lincoln gordonreed points out that while johnsons belief in an indissoluble union was sincere he had alienated southern leaders including davis who would soon be the president of the confederate states of america formed by the seceding states if the tennessean had backed the confederacy he would have had small influence in its government\\njohnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession his successor as governor isham g harris and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession when that failed they put the question of leaving the union to a popular vote despite threats on johnsons life and actual assaults he campaigned against both questions sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him although johnsons eastern region of tennessee was largely against secession the second referendum passed and in june 1861 tennessee joined the confederacy believing he would be killed if he stayed johnson fled through the cumberland gap where his party was in fact shot at he left his wife and family in greeneville\\nas the only member from a seceded state to remain in the senate and the most prominent southern unionist johnson had lincolns ear in the early months of the war with most of tennessee in confederate hands johnson spent congressional recesses in kentucky and ohio trying in vain to convince any union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into east tennessee\\nmilitary governor of tennessee\\njohnsons first tenure in the senate came to a conclusion in march 1862 when lincoln appointed him military governor of tennessee much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the confederates were defeated in an area lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over unioncontrolled southern regions the senate quickly confirmed johnsons nomination along with the rank of brigadier general in response the confederates confiscated his land and his slaves and turned his home into a military hospital later in 1862 after his departure from the senate and in the absence of most southern legislators the homestead bill was finally enacted along with legislation for landgrant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad the homestead bill has been credited with opening the american west to settlement\\nas military governor johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state he demanded loyalty oaths from public officials and shut down all newspapers owned by confederate sympathizers much of eastern tennessee remained in confederate hands and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought confederate control again close to nashville however the confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him johnson undertook the defense of nashville as well as he could though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by general nathan bedford forrest relief from union regulars did not come until general william s rosecrans defeated the confederates at murfreesboro in early 1863 much of eastern tennessee was captured later that year\\nwhen lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in january 1863 declaring freedom for all slaves in confederateheld areas he exempted tennessee at johnsons request the proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war as not all unionists supported abolition johnson finally decided that slavery had to end he wrote if the institution of slavery\\xa0 seeks to overthrow it the government then the government has a clear right to destroy it he reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the union army feeling that african americans should perform menial tasks to release white americans to do the fighting nevertheless he succeeded in recruiting 20000 black soldiers to serve the union\\nvice presidency 1865\\nin 1860 lincolns running mate had been senator hannibal hamlin of maine although hamlin had served competently was in good health and was willing to run again johnson emerged as running mate for lincolns reelection bid in 1864\\nlincoln considered several war democrats for the ticket in 1864 and sent an agent to sound out general benjamin butler as a possible running mate in may 1864 the president dispatched general daniel sickles to nashville on a factfinding mission although sickles denied that he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor johnson biographer hans l trefousse believes that sickless trip was connected to johnsons subsequent nomination for vice president according to historian albert castel in his account of johnsons presidency lincoln was impressed by johnsons administration of tennessee gordonreed points out that while the lincolnhamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860 having johnson the southern war democrat on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country another factor was the desire of secretary of state william seward to frustrate the vicepresidential candidacy of fellow new yorker and former senator daniel s dickinson a war democrat as seward would probably have had to yield his place if another new yorker became vice president johnson once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of sickles visit was active on his own behalf delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy\\nto sound a theme of unity in 1864 lincoln ran under the banner of the national union party rather than that of the republicans at the partys convention in baltimore in june lincoln was easily nominated although there had been some talk of replacing him with a cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals after the convention backed lincoln former secretary of war simon cameron offered a resolution to nominate hamlin but it was defeated johnson was nominated for vice president by cm allen of indiana with an iowa delegate as seconder on the first ballot johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for hamlin and 108 for dickinson on the second ballot kentucky switched to vote for johnson beginning a stampede johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to hamlins 17 and eight for dickinson the nomination was made unanimous lincoln expressed pleasure at the result andy johnson i think is a good man when word reached nashville a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the union\\nalthough it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign johnson gave a number of speeches in tennessee kentucky ohio and indiana he also sought to boost his chances in tennessee while reestablishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive in that voters would now have to swear that they opposed making a settlement with the confederacy the democratic candidate for president george mcclellan hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters lincoln declined to override johnson and their ticket took the state by 25000 votes congress refused to count tennessees electoral votes but lincoln and johnson did not need them having won in most states that had voted and easily secured the election\\nnow vice presidentelect johnson was eager to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in tennessee although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after inauguration day march 4 he hoped to remain in nashville to complete his task but was told by lincolns advisers that he could not stay but would be sworn in with lincoln in these months union troops finished the retaking of eastern tennessee including greeneville just before his departure the voters of tennessee ratified a new constitution which abolished slavery on february 22 1865 one of johnsons final acts as military governor was to certify the results\\njohnson traveled to washington to be sworn into office although according to gordonreed in light of what happened on march 4 1865 it might have been better if johnson had stayed in nashville johnson may have been ill castel cited typhoid fever though gordonreed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis on the evening of march 3 johnson attended a party in his honor at which he drank heavily hung over the following morning at the capitol he asked vice president hamlin for some whiskey hamlin produced a bottle and johnson took two stiff drinks stating i need all the strength for the occasion i can have in the senate chamber johnson delivered a rambling address as lincoln the congress and dignitaries looked on almost incoherent at times he finally meandered to a halt whereupon hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president lincoln who had watched sadly during the debacle then went to his own swearingin outside the capitol and delivered his acclaimed second inaugural address\\nin the weeks after the inauguration johnson only presided over the senate briefly and hid from public ridicule at the maryland home of a friend francis preston blair when he did return to washington it was with the intent of leaving for tennessee to reestablish his family in greeneville instead he remained after word came that general ulysses s grant had captured the confederate capital of richmond virginia presaging the end of the war lincoln stated in response to criticism of johnsons behavior that i have known andy johnson for many years he made a bad slip the other day but you need not be scared andy aint a drunkard\\npresidency 18651869\\naccession\\non the afternoon of april 14 1865 lincoln and johnson met for the first time since the inauguration trefousse states that johnson wanted to induce lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors gordonreed agrees\\nthat night president lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by john wilkes booth a confederate sympathizer the shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate lincoln johnson and seward the same night seward barely survived his wounds while johnson escaped attack as his wouldbe assassin george atzerodt got drunk instead of killing the vice president leonard j farwell a fellow boarder at the kirkwood house awoke johnson with news of lincolns shooting at fords theatre johnson rushed to the presidents deathbed where he remained a short time on his return promising they shall suffer for this they shall suffer for this lincoln died at 722\\xa0am the next morning johnsons swearingin occurred between 10 and 11\\xa0am with chief justice salmon p chase presiding in the presence of most of the cabinet johnsons demeanor was described by the newspapers as solemn and dignified some cabinet members had last seen johnson apparently drunk at the inauguration at noon johnson conducted his first cabinet meeting in the treasury secretarys office and asked all members to remain in their positions\\nthe events of the assassination resulted in speculation then and subsequently concerning johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him in the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of johnson was merely a ruse conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination booth came to the kirkwood house and left one of his cards with johnsons private secretary william a browning the message on it was dont wish to disturb you are you at home j wilkes booth\\njohnson presided with dignity over lincolns funeral ceremonies in washington before his predecessors body was sent home to springfield illinois for interment shortly after lincolns death union general william t sherman reported he had without consulting washington reached an armistice agreement with confederate general joseph e johnston for the surrender of confederate forces in north carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power with private property rights slaves to be respected this did not even grant freedom to those in slavery this was not acceptable to johnson or the cabinet who sent word for sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals which he did further johnson placed a 100000 bounty equivalent to  in  on confederate president davis then a fugitive which gave johnson the reputation of a man who would be tough on the south more controversially he permitted the execution of mary surratt for her part in lincolns assassination surratt was executed with three others including atzerodt on july 7 1865\\nreconstruction\\nbackground\\nupon taking office johnson faced the question of what to do with the former confederacy president lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in virginia arkansas louisiana and tennessee as the union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the union congress considered this too lenient its own plan requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath passed both houses in 1864 but lincoln pocket vetoed it\\njohnson had three goals in reconstruction he sought a speedy restoration of the states on the grounds that they had never truly left the union and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government to johnson africanamerican suffrage was a delay and a distraction it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote second political power in the southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved plebeians johnson feared that the freedmen many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters might vote at their direction johnsons third priority was election in his own right in 1868 a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish attempting to secure a democratic anticongressional reconstruction coalition in the south\\nthe republicans had formed a number of factions the radical republicans sought voting and other civil rights for african americans they believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote republican in gratitude for emancipation and that black votes could keep the republicans in power and southern democrats including former rebels out of influence they believed that top confederates should be punished the moderate republicans sought to keep the democrats out of power at a national level and prevent former rebels from resuming power they were not as enthusiastic about the idea of africanamerican suffrage as their radical colleagues either because of their own local political concerns or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly northern democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the southern states they did not support africanamerican suffrage which might threaten democratic control in the south\\npresidential reconstruction\\njohnson was initially left to devise a reconstruction policy without legislative intervention as congress was not due to meet again until december 1865 radical republicans told the president that the southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the union but johnson with the support of other officials including seward insisted that the franchise was a state not a federal matter the cabinet was divided on the issue\\njohnsons first reconstruction actions were two proclamations with the unanimous backing of his cabinet on may 29 one recognized the virginia government led by provisional governor francis pierpont the second provided amnesty for all exrebels except those holding property valued at 20000 or more it also appointed a temporary governor for north carolina and authorized elections neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmens rights the president ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states\\nas southern states began the process of forming governments johnsons policies received considerable public support in the north which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the south while he received such support from the white south he underestimated the determination of northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing it was important in northern public opinion that the south acknowledge its defeat that slavery be ended and that the lot of african americans be improved voting rights were less importantafter all only a handful of northern states mostly in new england gave africanamerican men the right to vote on the same basis as whites and in late 1865 connecticut wisconsin and minnesota voted down africanamerican suffrage proposals by large margins northern public opinion tolerated johnsons inaction on black suffrage as an experiment to be allowed if it quickened southern acceptance of defeat instead white southerners felt emboldened a number of southern states passed black codes binding africanamerican laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor most southerners elected to congress were former confederates with the most prominent being georgia senatordesignate and former confederate vice president alexander stephens congress assembled in early december 1865 johnsons conciliatory annual message to them was well received nevertheless congress refused to seat the southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate reconstruction legislation\\nnortherners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant confederate leaders such as stephens rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw they saw the black codes placing african americans in a position barely above slavery republicans also feared that restoration of the southern states would return the democrats to power in addition according to david o stewart in his book on johnsons impeachment the violence and poverty that oppressed the south would galvanize the opposition to johnson\\nbreak with the republicans 1866\\ncongress was reluctant to confront the president and initially only sought to finetune johnsons policies towards the south according to trefousse if there was a time when johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the republican party it was the period following the return of congress the president was unhappy about the provocative actions of the southern states and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there but made no statement publicly believing that southerners had a right to act as they did even if it was unwise to do so by late january 1866 he was convinced that winning a showdown with the radical republicans was necessary to his political plans  both for the success of reconstruction and for reelection in 1868 he would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise african americans in the district of columbia a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an allwhite referendum a bill to accomplish this passed the house of representatives but to johnsons disappointment stalled in the senate before he could veto it\\nillinois senator lyman trumbull leader of the moderate republicans and chairman of the judiciary committee was anxious to reach an understanding with the president he ushered through congress a bill extending the freedmens bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867 and the first civil rights bill to grant citizenship to the freedmen trumbull met several times with johnson and was convinced the president would sign the measures johnson rarely contradicted visitors often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord in fact the president opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty additionally both of trumbulls bills were unpopular among white southerners whom johnson hoped to include in his new party johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau bill on february 18 1866 to the delight of white southerners and the puzzled anger of republican legislators he considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the senate the following day johnson believed that the radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate republicans would form behind him he did not understand that moderates also wanted to see african americans treated fairly\\non february 22 1866 washingtons birthday johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the white house and called for an address in honor of the first president in his hourlong speech he instead referred to himself over 200 times more damagingly he also spoke of men\\xa0 still opposed to the union to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the south when called upon by the crowd to say who they were johnson named pennsylvania congressman thaddeus stevens massachusetts senator charles sumner and abolitionist wendell phillips and accused them of plotting his assassination republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war while one democratic ally estimated johnsons speech cost the party 200000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections\\nalthough strongly urged by moderates to sign the civil rights act of 1866 johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on march 27 in his veto message he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the congress and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites within three weeks congress had overridden his veto the first time that had been done on a major bill in american history the veto often seen as a key mistake of johnsons presidency convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him historian eric foner in his volume on reconstruction views it as the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career according to stewart the veto was for many his defining blunder setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency\\ncongress also proposed the fourteenth amendment to the states written by trumbull and others it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part though johnson opposed it the amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the civil rights act into the constitution but also went further the amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the united states except indians on reservations penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen and most importantly created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts it also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of confederate war debts further it disqualified many former confederates from office although the disability could be removed  by congress not the president both houses passed the freedmens bureau act a second time and again the president vetoed it this time the veto was overridden by the summer of 1866 when congress finally adjourned johnsons method of restoring states to the union by executive fiat without safeguards for the freedmen was in deep trouble his home state of tennessee ratified the fourteenth amendment despite the presidents opposition when tennessee did so congress immediately seated its proposed delegation embarrassing johnson\\nefforts to compromise failed and a political war ensued between the united republicans on one side and on the other johnson and his northern and southern allies in the democratic party he called a convention of the national union party republicans had returned to using their previous identifier johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term in 1868 the battleground was the election of 1866 southern states were not allowed to vote johnson campaigned vigorously undertaking a public speaking tour known as the swing around the circle the trip including speeches in chicago st louis indianapolis and columbus proved politically disastrous with the president making controversial comparisons between himself and christ and engaging in arguments with hecklers these exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency the republicans won by a landslide increasing their twothirds majority in congress and made plans to control reconstruction johnson blamed the democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the national union movement\\nradical reconstruction\\neven with the republican victory in november 1866 johnson considered himself in a strong position the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by none of the southern or border states except tennessee and had been rejected in kentucky delaware and maryland as the amendment required ratification by threequarters of the states to become part of the constitution he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor leading to his election in 1868 once it reconvened in december 1866 an energized congress began passing legislation often over a presidential veto this included the district of columbia voting bill congress admitted nebraska to the union over a veto and the republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment johnsons veto of a bill for statehood for colorado territory was sustained enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day\\nin january 1867 congressman stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts under martial law the states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions african americans could vote for or become delegates former confederates could not in the legislative process congress added to the bill that restoration to the union would follow the states ratification of the fourteenth amendment and completion of the process of adding it to the constitution johnson and the southerners attempted a compromise whereby the south would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former confederates and for limited black suffrage the republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment and the deal fell through although johnson could have pocket vetoed the first reconstruction act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the thirtyninth congress he chose to veto it directly on march 2 1867 congress overruled him the same day also on march 2 congress passed the tenure of office act over the presidents veto in response to statements during the swing around the circle that he planned to fire cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him this bill requiring senate approval for the firing of cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards was immediately controversial with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to johnson whose key cabinet officers were lincoln holdovers\\nimpeachment\\nsecretary of war edwin stanton was an able and hardworking man but difficult to deal with johnson both admired and was exasperated by his war secretary who in combination with general of the army grant worked to undermine the presidents southern policy from within his own administration johnson considered firing stanton but respected him for his wartime service as secretary stanton for his part feared allowing johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign despite his public disagreements with his president\\nthe new congress met for a few weeks in march 1867 then adjourned leaving the house committee on the judiciary behind charged with reporting back to the full house whether there were grounds for johnson to be impeached this committee duly met examined the presidents bank accounts and summoned members of the cabinet to testify when a federal court released former confederate president davis on bail on may 13 he had been captured shortly after the war the committee investigated whether the president had impeded the prosecution it learned that johnson was eager to have davis tried a bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges the committee adjourned on june 3\\nlater in june johnson and stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the south could override the civil authorities the president had attorney general henry stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not johnson sought to pin down stanton either as for and thus endorsing johnsons position or against showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the cabinet stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications when congress reconvened in july it passed a reconstruction act against johnsons position waited for his veto overrode it and went home in addition to clarifying the powers of the generals the legislation also deprived the president of control over the army in the south with congress in recess until november johnson decided to fire stanton and relieve one of the military commanders general philip sheridan who had dismissed the governor of texas and installed a replacement with little popular support johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from grant but on august 5 the president demanded stantons resignation the secretary refused to quit with congress out of session johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of congress as permitted under the tenure of office act grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army\\ngrant under protest followed johnsons order transferring sheridan and another of the district commanders daniel sickles who had angered johnson by firmly following congresss plan the president also issued a proclamation pardoning most confederates exempting those who held office under the confederacy or who had served in federal office before the war but had breached their oaths although republicans expressed anger with his actions the 1867 elections generally went democratic no seats in congress were directly elected in the polling but the democrats took control of the ohio general assembly allowing them to defeat for reelection one of johnsons strongest opponents senator benjamin wade voters in ohio connecticut and minnesota turned down propositions to grant african americans the vote\\nthe adverse results momentarily put a stop to republican calls to impeach johnson who was elated by the elections nevertheless once congress met in november the judiciary committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against johnson after much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor the standard under the constitution the resolution was defeated by the house of representatives on december 7 1867 by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed\\njohnson notified congress of stantons suspension and grants interim appointment in january 1868 the senate disapproved of his action and reinstated stanton contending the president had violated the tenure of office act grant stepped aside over johnsons objection causing a complete break between them johnson then dismissed stanton and appointed lorenzo thomas to replace him stanton refused to leave his office and on february 24 1868 the house impeached the president for intentionally violating the tenure of office act by a vote of 128 to 47 the house subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment for the most part alleging that he had violated the tenure of office act and had questioned the legitimacy of congress\\non march 5 1868 the impeachment trial began in the senate and lasted almost three months congressmen george s boutwell benjamin butler and thaddeus stevens acted as managers for the house or prosecutors and william m evarts benjamin r curtis and former attorney general stanbery were johnsons counsel chief justice chase served as presiding judge\\nthe defense relied on the provision of the tenure of office act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration since lincoln had appointed stanton the defense maintained johnson had not violated the act and also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of congress johnsons counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial nor publicly comment about the proceedings and except for a pair of interviews in april he complied\\njohnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal for example he pledged to iowa senator james w grimes that he would not interfere with congresss reconstruction efforts grimes reported to a group of moderates many of whom voted for acquittal that he believed the president would keep his word johnson also promised to install the respected john schofield as war secretary kansas senator edmund g ross received assurances that the new radicalinfluenced constitutions ratified in south carolina and arkansas would be transmitted to the congress without delay an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal\\none reason senators were reluctant to remove the president was that his successor would have been ohio senator wade the president pro tempore of the senate wade a lame duck who left office in early 1869 was a radical who supported such measures as womens suffrage placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation additionally a president wade was seen as an obstacle to grants ambitions\\nwith the dealmaking johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict and in the days leading up to the ballot newspapers reported that stevens and his radicals had given up on may 16 the senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment accusing johnson of firing stanton in violation of the tenure of office of act once the senate had overturned his suspension thirtyfive senators voted guilty and 19 not guilty thus falling short by a single vote of the twothirds majority required for conviction under the constitution seven republicanssenators grimes ross trumbull william pitt fessenden joseph s fowler john b henderson and peter g van winklevoted to acquit the president with stevens bitterly disappointed at the result the senate then adjourned for the republican national convention grant was nominated for president the senate returned on may 26 and voted on the second and third articles with identical 3519 results faced with those results johnsons opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings stanton relinquished his office on may 26 and the senate subsequently confirmed schofield when johnson renominated stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager the senate refused to confirm him\\nallegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial even when it was in progress representative butler began an investigation held contentious hearings and issued a report unendorsed by any other congressman butler focused on a new yorkbased astor house group supposedly led by political boss and editor thurlow weed this organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through cincinnati lawyer charles woolley to bribe senators to acquit johnson butler went so far as to imprison woolley in the capitol building when he refused to answer questions but failed to prove bribery\\nforeign policy\\nsoon after taking office as president johnson reached an accord with secretary of state william h seward that there would be no change in foreign policy in practice this meant that seward would continue to run things as he had under lincoln seward and lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860 the victor hoped that seward would succeed him as president in 1869 at the time of johnsons accession the french had intervened in mexico sending troops there while many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the mexican matter seward preferred quiet diplomacy warning the french through diplomatic channels that their presence in mexico was unacceptable although the president preferred a more aggressive approach seward persuaded him to follow his lead in april 1866 the french government informed seward that its troops would be brought home in stages to conclude by november 1867 on august 14 1866 johnson and his cabinet gave a reception for queen emma of hawaii who was returning to hawaii after her trip to britain and europe\\nseward was an expansionist and sought opportunities to gain territory for the united states after the loss of the crimean war in the 1850s the russian government saw its north american colony today alaska as a financial liability and feared losing control to britain whose troops would easily swoop in and annex the territory from neighboring canada in any future conflict negotiations between russia and the us over the sale of alaska were halted due to the outbreak of the civil war but after the us victory in the war talks resumed russia instructed its minister in washington baron eduard de stoeckl to negotiate a sale de stoeckl did so deftly getting seward to raise his offer from 5 million coincidentally the minimum that russia had instructed de stoeckl to accept to 7 million and then getting 200000 added by raising various objections this sum of 72 million is equivalent to  in presentday terms on march 30 1867 de stoeckl and seward signed the treaty working quickly as the senate was about to adjourn johnson and seward took the signed document to the presidents room in the capitol only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment the president summoned the senate into session to meet on april 1 that body approved the treaty 372 emboldened by his success in alaska seward sought acquisitions elsewhere his only success was staking an american claim to uninhabited wake island in the pacific which would be officially claimed by the us in 1898 he came close with the danish west indies as denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite but the senate never voted on the treaty and it expired\\nanother treaty that fared badly was the johnsonclarendon convention negotiated in settlement of the alabama claims for damages to american shipping from britishbuilt confederate raiders negotiated by the united states minister to britain former maryland senator reverdy johnson in late 1868 it was ignored by the senate during the remainder of the presidents term the treaty was rejected after he left office and the grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from britain\\nadministration and cabinet\\njudicial appointments\\njohnson appointed nine article iii federal judges during his presidency all to united states district courts he did not appoint a justice to serve on the supreme court in april 1866 he nominated henry stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of john catron but congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office johnson appointed his greeneville crony samuel milligan to the united states court of claims where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874\\nreforms initiated\\nin june 1866 johnson signed the southern homestead act into law believing that the legislation would assist poor whites around 28000 land claims were successfully patented although few former slaves benefitted from the law fraud was rampant and much of the best land was offlimits reserved for grants to veterans or railroads in june 1868 johnson signed an eighthour law passed by congress that established an eighthour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the federal government although johnson told members of a workingmens party delegation in baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eighthour day he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all according to richard f selcer however the good intentions behind the law were immediately frustrated as wages were cut by 20\\ncompletion of term\\njohnson sought nomination by the 1868 democratic national convention in new york in july 1868 he remained very popular among southern whites and boosted that popularity by issuing just before the convention a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any confederate not already indicted meaning that only davis and a few others still might face trial on the first ballot johnson was second to former ohio representative george h pendleton who had been his democratic opponent for vice president in 1864 johnsons support was mostly from the south and fell away as the ballots passed on the 22nd ballot former new york governor horatio seymour was nominated and the president received only four votes all from tennessee\\nthe conflict with congress continued johnson sent congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single sixyear term and make the president and the senate directly elected and for term limits for judges congress took no action on them when the president was slow to officially report ratifications of the fourteenth amendment by the new southern legislatures congress passed a bill again over his veto requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt he still delayed as much as he could but was required in july 1868 to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the constitution\\nseymours operatives sought johnsons support but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign it was not until october with the vote already having taken place in some states that he mentioned seymour at all and he never endorsed him nevertheless johnson regretted grants victory in part because of their animus from the stanton affair in his annual message to congress in december johnson urged the repeal of the tenure of office act and told legislators that had they admitted their southern colleagues in 1865 all would have been well he celebrated his 60th birthday in late december with a party for several hundred children though not including those of presidentelect grant who did not allow his to go\\non christmas day 1868 johnson issued a final amnesty this one covering everyone including davis he also issued in his final months in office pardons for crimes including one for dr samuel mudd controversially convicted of involvement in the lincoln assassination he had set booths broken leg and imprisoned in on floridas dry tortugas\\non march 3 the president hosted a large public reception at the white house on his final full day in office grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as johnson as was customary and johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all despite an effort by seward to prompt a change of mind he spent the morning of march 4 finishing lastminute business and then shortly after noon rode from the white house to the home of a friend\\npostpresidency 18691875\\nafter leaving the presidency johnson remained for some weeks in washington then returned to greeneville for the first time in eight years he was honored with large public celebrations along the way especially in tennessee where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners he had arranged to purchase a large farm near greeneville to live on after his presidency\\nsome expected johnson to run for governor of tennessee or for the senate again while others thought that he would become a railroad executive johnson found greeneville boring and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son robert in 1869 seeking vindication for himself and revenge against his political enemies he launched a senate bid soon after returning home tennessee had gone republican but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the ku klux klan suppressing the africanamerican vote leading to a democratic victory in the legislative elections in august 1869 johnson was seen as a likely victor in the senate election although hated by radical republicans and by some democrats because of his wartime activities although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislatures balloting the republicans eventually elected henry cooper over johnson 5451 in 1872 there was a special election for an  johnson initially sought the democratic nomination but when he saw that it would go to former confederate general benjamin f cheatham decided to run as an independent the former president was defeated finishing third but the split in the democratic party defeated cheatham in favor of an old johnson unionist ally horace maynard\\nin 1873 johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered that year he lost about 73000 when the first national bank of washington went under though he was eventually repaid much of the sum \\nreturn to the senate\\nhe began looking towards the next senate election to take place in the legislature in early 1875 johnson began to woo the farmers grange movement with his jeffersonian leanings he easily gained their support he spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour few african americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as reconstruction faded in tennessee setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other southern states the white domination would last almost a century in the tennessee legislative elections in august the democrats elected 92 legislators to the republicans eight and johnson went to nashville for the legislative session when the balloting for the senate seat began on january 20 1875 he led with 30 votes but did not have the required majority as three former confederate generals one former colonel and a former democratic congressman split the vote with him johnsons opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him but failed and he was elected on january 26 on the 54th ballot with a margin of a single vote nashville erupted in rejoicing remarked johnson thank god for the vindication\\njohnsons comeback garnered national attention with the st louis republican calling it the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of american politics can show at his swearingin in the senate on march 5 1875 he was greeted with flowers and sworn in alongside hamlin his predecessor as vice president by incumbent vice president henry wilson who as senator had voted for johnsons ouster many republicans ignored senator johnson though some such as ohios john sherman who had voted for conviction shook his hand johnson remains the only former president to serve in the senate he spoke only once in the short session on march 22 lambasting president grant for his use of federal troops in support of louisianas reconstruction government the former president asked how far off is military despotism and concluded his speech may god bless this people and god save the constitution\\ndeath\\njohnson returned home after the special session concluded in late july 1875 convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the ohio gubernatorial race he decided to travel there to give speeches he began the trip on july 28 and broke the journey at his daughter marys farm near elizabethton where his daughter martha was also staying that evening he suffered a stroke but refused medical treatment until the next day when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from elizabethton he seemed to respond to their ministrations but suffered another stroke on the evening of july 30 and died early the following morning at the age of 66 president grant had the painful duty of announcing the death of the only surviving past president northern newspapers in their obituaries tended to focus on johnsons loyalty during the war while southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president johnsons funeral was held on august 3 in greeneville he was buried with his body wrapped in an american flag and a copy of the us constitution placed under his head according to his wishes the burial ground was dedicated as the andrew johnson national cemetery in 1906 and with his home and tailors shop is part of the andrew johnson national historic site\\nhistorical reputation and legacy\\naccording to castel historians of johnsons presidency have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event reconstruction through the remainder of the 19th century there were few historical evaluations of johnson and his presidency memoirs from northerners who had dealt with him such as former vice president henry wilson and maine senator james g blaine depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the south in reconstruction but who was frustrated by congress according to historian howard k beale in his journal article about the historiography of reconstruction men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth thus alabama congressman and historian hilary herbert and his corroborators presented a southern indictment of northern policies and henry wilsons history was a brief for the north\\nthe turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of johnson leading the wave was pulitzer prizewinning historian james ford rhodes who wrote of the former president\\nrhodes ascribed johnsons faults to his personal weaknesses and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum south other early 20thcentury historians such as john burgess future president woodrow wilson and william dunning all southerners concurred with rhodes believing johnson flawed and politically inept but concluding that he had tried to carry out lincolns plans for the south in good faith author and journalist jay tolson suggests that wilson depicted reconstruction as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists the socalled carpetbaggers and cynical white southerners or scalawags who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain\\neven as rhodes and his school wrote another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of johnson using for the first time primary sources such as his papers provided by his daughter martha before her death in 1901 and the diaries of johnsons navy secretary gideon welles first published in 1911 the resulting volumes such as david miller dewitts the impeachment and trial of president andrew johnson 1903 presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him in james schoulers 1913 history of the reconstruction period the author accused rhodes of being quite unfair to johnson though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves these works had an effect although historians continued to view johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency they saw his reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct\\ncastel writes\\nbeale wondered in 1940 is it not time that we studied the history of reconstruction without first assuming at least subconsciously that carpetbaggers and southern white republicans were wicked that negroes were illiterate incompetents and that the whole white south owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of white supremacy despite these doubts the favorable view of johnson survived for a time in 1942 van heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the hollywood film tennessee johnson in 1948 a poll of his colleagues by historian arthur m schlesinger deemed johnson among the average presidents in 1956 one by clinton l rossiter named him as one of the neargreat chief executives foner notes that at the time of these surveys the reconstruction era that followed the civil war was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote\\nearlier historians including beale believed that money drove events and had seen reconstruction as an economic struggle they also accepted for the most part that reconciliation between north and south should have been the top priority of reconstruction in the 1950s historians began to focus on the africanamerican experience as central to reconstruction they rejected completely any claim of black inferiority which had marked many earlier historical works and saw the developing civil rights movement as a second reconstruction some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights these authors sympathized with the radical republicans for their desire to help the african american and saw johnson as callous towards the freedman in a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as fawn brodie the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedmans lot these volumes included major biographies of stevens and stanton reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society\\nin the early 21st century johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in us history according to historian glenn w lafantasie who believes buchanan the worst president johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment\\xa0 his complete mishandling of reconstruction policy\\xa0 his bristling personality and his enormous sense of selfimportance tolson suggests that johnson is now scorned for having resisted radical republican policies aimed at securing the rights and wellbeing of the newly emancipated africanamericans gordonreed notes that johnson along with his contemporaries pierce and buchanan is generally listed among the five worst presidents but states there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation the problems these men had to confront were enormous it would have taken a succession of lincolns to do them justice\\ntrefousse considers johnsons legacy to be the maintenance of white supremacy his boost to southern conservatives by undermining reconstruction was his legacy to the nation one that would trouble the country for generations to come gordonreed states of johnson\\nreferences\\nsources\\nprimary sources'}, {'title':

charitable club for workingclass boys in stepney in the east end of london run by his old school and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the clubs manager until then his political views had been more conservative however after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the slum children he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and income redistribution by the state would have any serious effect this sparked a process that caused him to convert to socialism he subsequently joined the independent labour party ilp in 1908 and became active in local politics in 1909 he stood unsuccessfully at his first election as an ilp candidate for stepney borough council\\nhe also worked briefly as a secretary for beatrice webb in 1909 before becoming a secretary for toynbee hall he worked for webbs campaign of popularisation of the minority report as he was very active in fabian socialist circles

administration \\nmilitary service during the first world war\\nfollowing the outbreak of the first world war in august 1914 attlee applied to join the british army initially his application was turned down as at the age of 31 he was seen as being too old however he was eventually commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the 6th service battalion south lancashire regiment on 30 september 1914 on 9 february 1915 he was promoted to captain and on 14 march was appointed battalion adjutant the 6th south lancashires were part of the 38th brigade of the 13th western division which served in the gallipoli campaign in turkey attlees decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother tom who as a conscientious objector spent much of the war in prison\\nafter a period spent fighting in gallipoli attlee collapsed after falling ill with dysentery and was put on a ship bound for england to recover when he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible and asked to be let off the ship in malta where he stayed in hospital in order to recover his hospitalisation coincided with the battle of sari bair which saw a large number of his comrades killed upon returning to action he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the evacuation of suvla as such he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from suvla bay the last being general stanley maude\\nthe gallipoli campaign had been engineered by the first lord of the admiralty winston churchill although it was unsuccessful attlee believed that it was a bold strategy which could have been successful if it had been better implemented on the ground this led to an admiration for churchill as a military strategist something which would make their working relationship in later years productive\\nhe later served in the mesopotamian campaign in what is now iraq where in april 1916 he was badly wounded being hit in the leg by shrapnel while storming an enemy trench during the battle of hanna he was sent firstly to india and then back to the uk to recover on 18 december 1916 he was transferred to the heavy section of the machine gun corps and 1 march 1917 he was

to france in june 1918 to serve on the western front for the final months of the war after being discharged from the army in january 1919 he returned to stepney and returned to his old job lecturing parttime at the london school of economics\\nmarriage and children\\nattlee met violet millar while on a long trip with friends to italy in 1921 they fell in love and were soon engaged marrying at christ church hampstead on 10 january 1922 it would come to be a devoted marriage with attlee providing protection and violet providing a home that was an escape for attlee from political turmoil she died in 1964 they had four children\\nearly political career\\nlocal politics\\nattlee returned to local politics in the immediate postwar period becoming mayor of the metropolitan borough of stepney one of londons most deprived innercity boroughs in 1919 during his time as mayor the council undertook action to tackle slum landlords who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition the council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property it also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors reducing the infant mortality rate and took action to find work for returning unemployed exservicemen\\nin 1920 while mayor he wrote his first book the social worker which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years the book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action he wrote on page 30in a civilised community although it may be composed of selfreliant individuals there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways  they may be neglected they may be cared for by the organised community as of right or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community\\nand went on to say at page 75charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals a right established by law such as that to an old age pension is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one dependent on his view of the recipients character and terminable at his caprice\\nin 1921 george lansbury the labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of poplar and future labour party leader launched the poplar rates rebellion a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the london boroughs attlee who was a personal friend of lansbury strongly supported this however herbert morrison the labour mayor of nearby hackney and one of the main figures in the london labour party strongly denounced lansbury and the rebellion during this period attlee developed a lifelong dislike of morrison\\nmember of parliament\\nat the 1922 general election attlee became the member of parliament mp for the constituency of limehouse in stepney at the time he admired ramsay macdonald and helped him get elected as labour party leader at the 1922 leadership election he served as macdonalds parliamentary private secretary for the brief 1922 parliament his first taste of ministerial office came in 1924 when he served as undersecretary of state for war in the shortlived first labour government led by macdonald\\nattlee opposed the 1926 general strike believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon however when it happened he did not attempt to undermine it at the time of the strike he was chairman of the stepney borough electricity committee he negotiated a deal with the electrical trade union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals but would end supplies to factories one firm scammell and nephew ltd took a civil action against attlee and the other labour members of the committee although not against the conservative members who had also supported this the court found against attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay 300 damages the decision was later reversed on appeal but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced attlee out of politics\\nin 1927 he was appointed a member of the multiparty simon commission a royal commission set up to examine the possibility of granting selfrule to india due to the time he needed to devote to the commission and contrary to a promise macdonald made to attlee to induce him to serve on the commission he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the second labour government which entered office after the 1929 general election attlees service on the commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to india and many of its political leaders by 1933 he argued that british rule was alien to india and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for indias progress he became the british leader most sympathetic to indian independence as a dominion preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947\\nin may 1930 labour mp oswald mosley left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem and attlee was given mosleys post of chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in march 1931 he became postmaster general a post he held for five months until august when the labour government fell after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the great depression that month macdonald and a few of his allies formed a national government with the conservatives and liberals leading them to be expelled from labour macdonald offered attlee a job in the national government but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main labour party\\nafter ramsay macdonald formed the national government labour was deeply divided attlee had long been close to macdonald and now felt betrayedas did most labour politicians during the course of the second labour government attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with macdonald whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography he would write\\nin the old days i had looked up to macdonald as a great leader he had a fine presence and great oratorical power the unpopular line which he took during the first world war seemed to mark him as a man of character despite his mishandling of the red letter episode i had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time i then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery while his habit of telling me a junior minister the poor opinion he had of all his cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression i had not however expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country\\xa0 the shock to the party was very great especially to the loyal workers of the rankandfile who had made great sacrifices for these men\\n1930s opposition\\ndeputy leader\\nthe 1931 general election held later that year was a disaster for the labour party which lost over 200 seats returning only 52 mps to parliament the vast majority of the partys senior figures including the leader arthur henderson lost their seats attlee however narrowly retained his limehouse seat with his majority being slashed from 7288 to just 551 he was one of only three labour mps who had experience of government to retain their seats along with george lansbury and stafford cripps accordingly lansbury was elected leader unopposed with attlee as his deputy\\nmost of the remaining labour mps after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates lansbury was in his 70s and stafford cripps another main figure of the labour front bench who had entered parliament in 1931 was inexperienced as one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining labour mps attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the national government in the years 193135 during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government\\nattlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from december 1933 after lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident which raised attlees public profile considerably it was during this period however that personal financial problems almost forced attlee to quit politics altogether his wife had become ill and at that time there was no separate salary for the leader of the opposition on the verge of resigning from parliament he was persuaded to stay by stafford cripps a wealthy socialist who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until lansbury could take over again\\nduring 193233 attlee flirted with and then drew back from radicalism influenced by stafford cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party he was briefly a member of the socialist league which had been formed by former independent labour party ilp members who opposed the ilps disaffiliation from the main labour party in 1932 at one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy he admired oliver cromwells strongarmed rule and use of major generals to control england after looking more closely at hitler mussolini stalin and even his former colleague oswald mosley leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in britain attlee retreated from his radicalism and distanced himself from the league and argued instead that the labour party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against totalitarianism of either the left or right he always supported the crown and as prime minister was close to king george\\xa0vi\\nleader of the opposition\\ngeorge lansbury a committed pacifist resigned as the leader of the labour party at the 1935 party conference on 8 october after delegates voted in favour of sanctions against italy for its aggression against abyssinia lansbury had strongly opposed the policy and felt unable to continue leading the party taking advantage of the disarray in the labour party the prime minister stanley baldwin announced on 19 october that a general election would be held on 14 november with no time for a leadership contest the party agreed that attlee should serve as interim leader on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election attlee therefore led labour through the 1935 election which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance winning 38 per cent of the vote the highest share labour had won up to that point and gaining over one hundred seats\\nattlee stood in the subsequent leadership election held soon after where he was opposed by herbert morrison who had just reentered parliament in the recent election and arthur greenwood morrison was seen as the favourite but was distrusted by many sections of the party especially the leftwing arthur greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party however his leadership bid was severely hampered by his alcohol problem attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure particularly having already led the party through a general election he went on to come first in both the first and second ballots formally being elected leader of the labour party on 3 december 1935\\nthroughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s the labour partys official policy had been to oppose rearmament instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the league of nations at the 1934 labour party conference attlee declared that we have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty we are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country we say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country during a debate on defence in commons a year later attlee said we are told in the white paper that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves we do not think you can do it by national defence we think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world a world of law the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system i shall be told that that is quite impossible shortly after those comments adolf hitler proclaimed that german rearmament offered no threat to world peace attlee responded the next day noting that hitlers speech although containing unfavourable references to the soviet union created a chance to call a halt in the armaments race\\xa0 we do not think that our answer to herr hitler should be just rearmament we are in an age of rearmaments but we on this side cannot accept that position\\nattlee played little part in the events that would lead up to the abdication of edward\\xa0viii as despite baldwins threat to step down if edward attempted to remain on the throne after marrying wallis simpson labour were widely accepted not to be a viable alternative government due to the national governments overwhelming majority in the commons attlee along with liberal leader archibald sinclair was eventually consulted with by baldwin on 24 november 1936 and attlee agreed with both baldwin and sinclair that edward could not remain on the throne firmly eliminating any prospect of any alternative government forming were baldwin to resign\\nin april 1936 the chancellor of the exchequer neville chamberlain introduced a budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it saying\\nin june 1936 the conservative mp duff cooper called for an anglofrench alliance against possible german aggression and called for all parties to support one attlee condemned this we say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kindan alliance in which one country is bound to another right or wrong by some overwhelming necessityis contrary to the spirit of the league of nations is contrary to the covenant is contrary to locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken and is contrary to the professed policy of this government at the labour party conference at edinburgh in october attlee reiterated that there can be no question of our supporting the government in its rearmament policy\\nhowever with the rising threat from nazi germany and the ineffectiveness of the league of nations this policy eventually lost credibility by 1937 labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose neville chamberlains policy of appeasement\\nat the end of 1937 attlee and a party of three labour mps visited spain and visited the british battalion of the international brigades fighting in the spanish civil war one of the companies was named the major attlee company in his honour in the house of commons attlee stated i cannot understand the delusion that if franco wins with italian and german aid he will immediately become independent i think it is a ridiculous proposition dalton the labour partys spokesman on foreign policy also thought that franco would ally with germany and italy however francos subsequent behaviour proved it was not such a ridiculous proposition as dalton later acknowledged franco skilfully maintained spanish neutrality whereas hitler would have occupied spain if franco had lost the civil war\\nin 1938 attlee opposed the munich agreement in which chamberlain negotiated with hitler to give germany the germanspeaking parts of czechoslovakia the sudetenland we all feel relief that war has not come this time every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety we cannot however feel that peace has been established but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war we have been unable to go in for carefree rejoicing we have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy we have felt humiliation this has not been a victory for reason and humanity it has been a victory for brute force at every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force the terms have not been terms negotiated they have been terms laid down as ultimata we have seen today a gallant civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism we have seen something more we have seen the cause of democracy which is in our view the cause of civilisation and humanity receive a terrible defeat\\xa0 the events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and france have ever sustained there can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for herr hitler without firing a shot by the mere display of military force he has achieved a dominating position in europe which germany failed to win after four years of war he has overturned the balance of power in europe he has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in eastern europe which stood in the way of his ambition he has opened his way to the food the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence\\nand\\nthe cause of the crisis which we have undergone was not the existence of minorities in czechoslovakia it was not that the position of the sudeten germans had become intolerable it was not the wonderful principle of selfdetermination it was because herr hitler had decided that the time was ripe for another step forward in his design to dominate europe\\xa0 the minorities question is no new one it existed before the first world war and it existed after the war because the problem of germans in czechoslovakia succeeded that of the czechs in german austria just as the problem of germans in the tyrol succeeded that of the italians in trieste and short of a drastic and entire reshuffling of these populations there is no possible solution to the problem of minorities in europe except toleration\\nhowever the new czechoslovakian state did not provide equal rights to the slovaks and sudeten germans with the historian arnold j toynbee already having noted that for the germans magyars and poles who account between them for more than one quarter of the whole population the present regime in czechoslovakia is not essentially different from the regimes in the surrounding countries eden in the munich debate acknowledged that there had been discrimination even severe discrimination against the sudeten germans\\nin 1937 attlee wrote a book entitled the labour party in perspective that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views he argued that there was no point in labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success he wrote i find that the proposition often reduces itself to this  that if the labour party would drop its socialism and adopt a liberal platform many liberals would be pleased to support it i have heard it said more than once that if labour would only drop its policy of nationalisation everyone would be pleased and it would soon obtain a majority i am convinced it would be fatal for the labour party he also wrote that there was no point in watering down labours socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith on the contrary i believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support\\nin the late 1930s attlee sponsored a jewish mother and her two children enabling them to leave germany in 1939 and move to the uk on arriving in britain attlee invited one of the children into his home in stanmore northwest london where he stayed for several months\\ndeputy prime minister\\nattlee remained as leader of the opposition when the second world war broke out in september 1939 the ensuing disastrous norwegian campaign would result in a motion of no confidence in neville chamberlain although chamberlain survived this the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a coalition government would be necessary even if attlee had personally been prepared to serve under chamberlain in an emergency coalition government he would never have been able to carry labour with him consequently chamberlain tendered his resignation and labour and the conservatives entered a coalition government led by winston churchill on 10 may 1940 with attlee joining the cabinet as lord privy seal on 12 may\\nattlee and churchill quickly agreed that the war cabinet would consist of three conservatives initially churchill chamberlain and lord halifax and two labour members initially himself and arthur greenwood and that labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government attlee and greenwood played a vital role in supporting churchill during a series of war cabinet debates over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with hitler following the fall of france in may 1940 both supported churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the war cabinet to continue britains resistance\\nonly attlee and churchill remained in the war cabinet from the formation of the government of national unity in may 1940 through to the election in may 1945 attlee was initially the lord privy seal before becoming britains first ever deputy prime minister in 1942 as well as becoming the dominions secretary and lord president of the council on 28 september 1943\\nattlee himself played a generally low key but vital role in the wartime government working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government in the coalition government three interconnected committees effectively ran the country churchill chaired the first two the war cabinet and the defence committee with attlee deputising for him in these and answering for the government in parliament when churchill was absent attlee himself instituted and later chaired the third body the lord presidents committee which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs as churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort this arrangement suited both men attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with churchills backing streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees he also acted as a concilliator in the government smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between labour and conservative ministers\\nmany labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma beatrice webb wrote in her diary in early 1940\\nhe looked and spoke like an insignificant elderly clerk without distinction in the voice manner or substance of his discourse to realise that this little nonentity is the parliamentary leader of the labour party\\xa0 and presumably the future pm prime minister is pitiable\\nprime minister\\n1945 election\\nfollowing the defeat of nazi germany and the end of the war in europe in may 1945 attlee and churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until japan had been defeated however herbert morrison made it clear that the labour party would not be willing to accept this and churchill was forced to tender his resignation as prime minister and call an immediate election\\nthe war had set in motion profound social changes within britain and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for social reform this mood was epitomised in the beveridge report of 1942 by the liberal economist william beveridge the report assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of postwar governments and that this would provide the basis for the welfare state immediately on its release it sold hundreds of thousands of copies all major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim but most historians say that attlees labour party were seen by the electorate as the party most likely to follow it through\\nlabour campaigned on the theme of let us face the future positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild britain following the war and were widely viewed as having run a strong and positive campaign while the conservative campaign centred entirely around churchill despite opinion polls indicating a strong labour lead opinion polls were then viewed as a novelty which had not proven their worth and most commentators expected that churchills prestige and status as a war hero would ensure a comfortable conservative victory before polling day the manchester guardian surmised that the chances of labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority\\xa0 are pretty remote the news of the world predicted a working conservative majority while in glasgow a pundit forecast the result as conservatives 360 labour 220 others 60 churchill however made some costly errors during the campaign in particular his suggestion during one radio broadcast that a future labour government would require some form of a gestapo to implement their policies was widely regarded as being in very bad taste and massively backfired\\nwhen the results of the election were announced on 26 july they came as a surprise to most including attlee himself labour had won power by a huge landslide winning 477 per cent of the vote to the conservatives 36 per cent this gave them 393 seats in the house of commons a working majority of 146 this was the first time in history that the labour party had won a majority in parliament when attlee went to see king george\\xa0vi at buckingham palace to be appointed prime minister the notoriously laconic attlee and the famously tonguetied king stood in silence attlee finally volunteered the remark ive won the election the king replied i know i heard it on the six oclock news\\nas prime minister attlee appointed hugh dalton as chancellor of the exchequer ernest bevin as foreign secretary and herbert morrison as deputy prime minister with overall responsibility for nationalisation additionally stafford cripps was made president of the board of trade aneurin bevan became minister of health and ellen wilkinson the only woman to serve in attlees cabinet was appointed minister of education the attlee government proved itself to be a radical reforming government from 1945 to 1948 over 200 public acts of parliament were passed with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone\\ndomestic policy\\nfrancis 1995 argues there was consensus both in the labours national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement the attlee government was committed to rebuilding british society as an ethical commonwealth using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty labours ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary conservative partys defence of individualism inherited privileges and income inequality on 5 july 1948 clement attlee replied to a letter dated 22 june from james murray and ten other mps who raised concerns about west indians who arrived on board the  as for the prime minister himself he was not much focused on economic policy letting others handle the issues\\nhealth\\nattlees health minister aneurin bevan fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment including the british medical association by creating the national health service nhs in 1948 this was a publicly funded healthcare system which offered treatment free of charge for all at the point of use reflecting pentup demand that had long existed for medical services the nhs treated some 8 and a half million dental patients and dispensed more than 5\\xa0million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation\\nwelfare\\nthe government set about implementing the wartime plans of liberal william beveridge for the creation of a cradle to grave welfare state it set in place an entirely new system of social security among the most important pieces of legislation was the national insurance act 1946 in which people in work were required to pay a flat rate of national insurance in return they and the wives of male contributors were eligible for a wide range of benefits including pensions sickness benefit unemployment benefit and funeral benefit various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income in 1949 unemployment sickness and maternity benefits were exempted from tax\\nhousing\\nthe new towns act 1946 set up development corporations to construct new towns while the town and country planning act 1947 instructed county councils to prepare development plans and also provided compulsory purchase powers the attlee government also extended the powers of local authorities to requisition houses and parts of houses and made the acquisition of land less difficult than before the housing scotland act 1949 provided grants of 75 per cent 875 per cent in the highlands and islands towards modernisation costs payable by treasury to local authorities\\nin 1949 local authorities were empowered to provide people suffering from poor health with public housing at subsidised rents\\nto assist home ownership the limit on the amount of money that people could borrow from their local authority to purchase or build a home was raised from 800 to 1500 in 1945 and to 5000 in 1949 under the national assistance act 1948 local authorities had a duty to provide emergency temporary accommodation for families which become homeless through no fault of their own\\na large housebuilding programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with highquality homes the housing financial and miscellaneous provisions act 1946 increased treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in england and wales four out of five houses constructed under labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the second world war and subsidies kept down council rents altogether these policies provided publicsector housing with its biggestever boost up until that point while lowwage earners particularly benefited from these developments although the attlee government failed to meet its targets primarily due to economic constraints over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 a significant achievement under the circumstances which ensured that decent affordable housing was available to many lowincome families for the first time ever\\nwomen and children\\na number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children in 1946 universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children these benefits had been legislated for the previous year by churchills family allowances act 1945 and was the first measure pushed through parliament by attlees government conservatives would later criticise labour for having been too hasty in introducing family allowances\\na married women restraint upon anticipation act was passed in 1949 to equalise to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman while the married women maintenance act 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women\\nthe criminal law amendment act 1950 amended the criminal law amendment act 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse the criminal justice act 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems while the passage of the justices of the peace act 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates courts the attlee government also abolished the marriage bar in the civil service thereby enabling married women to work in that institution\\nin 1946 the government set up a national institute of houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service\\nby late 1946 agreed standards of training were established which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine training centres in wales scotland and then throughout great britain the national health service act 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required owing to the presence of any person who is ill lyingin an expectant mother mentally defective aged or a child not over compulsory school age home help therefore included the provision of homehelps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five and by 1952 some 20000 women were engaged in this service\\nplanning and development\\ndevelopment rights were nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the state strong planning authorities were set up to control land use and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land a chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies\\ncomprehensive development areas cdas a designation under the town and country planning act 1947 allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to replan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage\\nworkers rights\\nvarious measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948 workers compensation was also significantly improved\\nthe fair wages resolution of 1946 required any contractor working on a public project to at least match the pay rates and other employment conditions set in the appropriate collective agreement in 1946 purchase tax was removed completely from kitchen fittings and crockery while the rate was reduced on various gardening items\\nthe fire services act 1947 introduced a new pension scheme for firefighters while the electricity act 1947 introduced better retirement benefits for workers in that industry a workers compensation supplementation act was passed in 1948 that introduced benefits for workers with certain asbestosrelated diseases which had occurred before 1948 the merchant shipping act 1948 and the merchant shipping safety convention act 1949 were passed to improve conditions for seamen the shops act 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided that no one could be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes the legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone who worked between 1130\\xa0am and 230\\xa0pm and a halfhour tea break for anyone working between 4\\xa0pm and 7\\xa0pm the government also strengthened a fair wages resolution with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions\\nthe trade disputes and trade unions act 1927 was repealed and the dock labour scheme was introduced in 1947 to put an end to the casual system of hiring labour in the docks this scheme gave registered dockers the legal right to minimum work and decent conditions through the national dock labour board on which trade unions and employers had equal representation the unions acquired control over recruitment and dismissal registered dockers laid off by employers within the scheme had the right either to be taken on by another or to generous compensation all dockers were registered under the dock labour scheme giving them a legal right to minimum work holidays and sick pay\\nwages for members of the police force were significantly increased the introduction of a miners charter in 1946 instituted a fiveday work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure and in 1948 a colliery workers supplementary scheme was approved providing supplementary allowances to disabled coalworkers and their dependants in 1948 a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new nhs as well as their dependants under the coal industry nationalisation superannuation regulations 1950 a pension scheme for mineworkers was established improvements were also made in farmworkers wages and the agricultural wages board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation\\na number of regulations aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of people at work were also introduced during attlees time in office regulations issued in february 1946 applied to factories involved with manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal coal dust coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance and concerned dust and ventilation washing facilities and clothing accommodation medical supervision and examination skin and eye protection and messrooms\\nnationalisation\\nattlees government also carried out their manifesto commitment for nationalisation of basic industries and public utilities the bank of england and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946 coal mining the railways road haulage canals and cable and wireless were nationalised in 1947 and electricity and gas followed in 1948 the steel industry was nationalised in 1951 by 1951 about 20 per cent of the british economy had been taken into public ownership\\nnationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked it did however bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages reduced working hours and improvements in working conditions especially in regards to safety as historian eric shaw noted of the years following nationalisation the electricity and gas supply companies became impressive models of public enterprise in terms of efficiency and the national coal board was not only profitable but working conditions for miners had significantly improved as well\\nwithin a few years of nationalisation a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines including better pay a fiveday working week a national safety scheme with proper standards at all the collieries a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility\\nthe newly established national coal board offered sick pay and holiday pay to miners as noted by martin francis\\nunion leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations moreover most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialist relationships in the workplace\\nagriculture\\nthe attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas benefiting both farmers and other consumers security of tenure for farmers was introduced while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments between 1945 and 1951 the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas electricity and water services as well as in leisure and public amenities in addition the 1947 transport act improved provision of rural bus services while the agriculture act 1947 established a more generous subsidy system for farmers legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent agricultural wages board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers\\nattlees government made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90 per cent of the cost of building their own houses and received a subsidy of 15 a year for 40 years towards that cost grants were also made to meet up to half the cost of supplying water to farm buildings and fields the government met half the cost of bracken eradication and lime spreading and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes\\nin 1946 the national agricultural advisory service was set up to supply agricultural advice and information the hill farming act 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings land improvement and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification the act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war the agricultural holdings act 1948 enabled in effect tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies in addition the livestock rearing act 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 hill farming act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector\\nat a time of world food shortages it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities the government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation while the national agricultural advisory service provided expertise and price guarantees as a result of the attlee governments initiatives in agriculture there was a 20 per cent increase in output between 1947 and 1952 while britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world\\neducation\\nthe attlee government ensured provisions of the education act 1944 were fully implemented with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time fees in state grammar schools were eliminated while new modern secondary schools were constructed\\nthe school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947 an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the horsa huts operation for raising the schoolleaving age scheme and the sforsa furniture scheme university scholarships were introduced to ensure that no one who was qualified should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons while a large school building programme was organised a rapid increase in the number of trained teachers took place and the number of new school places was increased\\nincreased treasury funds were made available for education particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage prefabricated classrooms were built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950 the provision of free school meals was expanded and opportunities for university entrants were increased state scholarships to universities were increased and the government adopted a policy of supplementing university scholarships awards to a level sufficient to cover fees plus maintenance\\nmany thousands of exservicemen were assisted to go through college who could never have contemplated it before the war free milk was also made available to all schoolchildren for the first time in addition spending on technical education rose and the number of nursery schools was increased salaries for teachers were also improved and funds were allocated towards improving existing schools\\nin 1947 the arts council of great britain was set up to encourage the arts\\nthe ministry of education was established under the 1944 act and free county colleges were set up for the compulsory parttime instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in fulltime education an emergency training scheme was also introduced which turned out an extra 25000 teachers in 19451951 in 1947 regional advisory councils were set up to bring together industry and education to find out the needs of young workers and advise on the provision required and to secure reasonable economy of provision that same year thirteen area training organisations were set up in england and one in wales to coordinate teacher training\\nattlees government however failed to introduce the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped this reform was eventually carried out by harold wilsons government during its time in office the attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent from 65\\xa0billion to 10\\xa0billion\\neconomy\\nthe most significant problem facing attlee and his ministers remained the economy as the war effort had left britain nearly bankrupt the war had cost britain about a quarter of her national wealth overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war the transition to a peacetime economy and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade this resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports boost exports and stabilise the pound sterling so that britain could trade its way out of its financial state\\nthe abrupt end of the american lendlease programme in august 1945 almost caused a crisis some relief was provided by the angloamerican loan negotiated in december 1945 the conditions attached to the loan included making the pound fully convertible to the us dollar when this was introduced in july 1947 it led to a currency crisis and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks the uk benefited from the american marshall aid program in 1948 and the economic situation improved significantly another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced chancellor of the exchequer stafford cripps into devaluation of the pound\\ndespite these problems one of the main achievements of attlees government was the maintenance of near full employment the government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy including control over the allocation of materials and manpower and unemployment rarely rose above 500000 or 3 per cent of the total workforce labour shortages proved a more frequent problem the inflation rate was also kept low during his term the rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during attlees time in office whilst there was no hardcore of longterm unemployed both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment while the average working week was shortened\\nthe government was less successful in housing which was the responsibility of aneurin bevan the government had a target to build 400000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built nevertheless millions of people were rehoused as a result of the attlee governments housing policies between august 1945 and december 1951 1016349 new homes were completed in england scotland and wales\\nwhen the attlee government was voted out of office in 1951 the economy had been improved compared to 1945 the period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards which increased by about 10 per cent each year during that same period the economy grew by 3 per cent a year and by 1951 the uk had the best economic performance in europe while output per person was increasing faster than in the united states careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery and that unemployment stayed at very low levels in addition the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3\\xa0million to 5\\xa0million from 1945 to 1951 and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before a monopolies and restrictive practices inquiry and control act was passed in 1948 which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies\\nenergy\\n1947 proved a particularly difficult year for the government an exceptionally cold winter that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production creating widespread power cuts and food shortages the minister of fuel and power emanuel shinwell was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks and soon resigned from his post the conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan starve with strachey and shiver with shinwell referring to the minister of food john strachey\\nthe crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by hugh dalton to replace attlee as prime minister with ernest bevin later that year stafford cripps tried to persuade attlee to stand aside for bevin these plots petered out after bevin refused to cooperate later that year hugh dalton resigned as chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist he was replaced by cripps\\nforeign policy\\neurope and the cold war\\nin foreign affairs the attlee government was concerned with four main issues postwar europe the onset of the cold war the establishment of the united nations and decolonisation the first two were closely related and attlee was assisted by foreign secretary ernest bevin attlee also attended the later stages of the potsdam conference where he negotiated with president harry s truman and joseph stalin\\nin the immediate aftermath of the war the government faced the challenge of managing relations with britains former wartime ally stalin and the soviet union ernest bevin was a passionate anticommunist based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement bevins initial approach to the ussr as foreign secretary was wary and suspicious but not automatically hostile attlee himself sought warm relations with stalin he put his trust in the united nations rejected notions that the soviet union was bent on world conquest and warned that treating moscow as an enemy would turn it into one this put attlee at swords point with his foreign minister the foreign office and the military who all saw the soviets as a growing threat to britains role in the middle east suddenly in january 1947 attlee reversed his position and agreed with bevin on a hardline antisoviet policy\\nin an early goodwill gesture that was later heavily criticised the attlee government allowed the soviets to purchase under the terms of a 1946 ukussr trade agreement a total of 25 rollsroyce nene jet engines in september 1947 and march 1948 the agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes the price was fixed under a commercial contract a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the ussr in 1947 however the cold war intensified during this period and the soviets who at the time were well behind the west in jet technology reverseengineered the nene and installed their own version in the mig15 interceptor this was used to good effect against usuk forces in the subsequent korean war as well as in several later mig models\\nafter stalin took political control of most of eastern europe and began to subvert other governments in the balkans attlees and bevins worst fears of soviet intentions were realised the attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful nato defence alliance to protect western europe against any soviet expansion in a crucial contribution to the economic stability of postwar europe attlees cabinet was instrumental in promoting the american marshall plan for the economic recovery of europe he called it one of the most bold enlightened and goodnatured acts in the history of nations\\na group of labour mps organised under the banner of keep left urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers and advocated the creation of a third force of european powers to stand between the us and ussr however deteriorating relations between britain and the ussr as well as britains economic reliance on america following the marshall plan steered policy towards supporting the us in january 1947 fear of both soviet and american nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the cabinet where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of britains independent nuclear deterrent an issue which later caused a split in the labour party britains first successful nuclear test however did not occur until 1952 one year after attlee had left office\\nthe london dock strike of july 1949 led by communists was suppressed when the attlee government sent in 13000 army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike his response reveals attlees growing concern that soviet expansionism supported by the british communist party was a genuine threat to national security and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by moscow he noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances but to help communist unions who were on strike in canada attlee agreed with mi5 that he faced a very present menace\\ndecolonisation\\ndecolonisation was never a major election issue but attlee gave the matter a great deal of attention and was the chief leader in beginning the process of decolonisation of the british empire\\nchina and hong kong\\nin august 1948 the chinese communists victories caused attlee to begin preparing for a communist takeover of china it kept open consulates in communistcontrolled areas and rejected the chinese nationalists requests that british citizens assist in the defence of shanghai by december the government concluded that although british property in china would likely be nationalised british traders would benefit in the long run from a stable industrialising communist china retaining hong kong was especially important to him although the chinese communists promised to not interfere with its rule britain reinforced the hong kong garrison during 1949 when the victorious chinese communists government declared on 1 october 1949 that it would exchange diplomats with any country that ended relations with the chinese nationalists britain became the first western country to formally recognise the peoples republic of china in january 1950\\nin 1954 a labour party delegation including attlee visited china at the invitation of then foreign minister zhou enlai attlee became the first highranking western politician to meet mao zedong\\nindia and pakistan\\nattlee orchestrated the granting of independence to india and pakistan in 1947 attlee in 19281934 had been a member of the indian statutory commission otherwise known as the simon commission he became the labour party expert on india and by 1934 was committed to granting india the same independent dominion status that canada australia new zealand and south africa had recently been given he faced strong resistance from the diehard conservative imperialists led by churchill who opposed both independence and efforts led by prime minister stanley baldwin to set up a system of limited local control by indians themselves attlee and the labour leadership were sympathetic to the congress movement led by mahatma gandhi and jawaharlal nehru and pakistan movement led by muhammad ali jinnah during the second world war attlee was in charge of indian affairs he set up the cripps mission in 1942 which tried and failed to bring the factions together when the congress called for passive resistance in the quit india movement of 19421945 it was attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of congress leaders and crushed the revolt\\nlabours election manifesto in 1945 called for the advancement of india to responsible selfgovernment but did not mention independence in 1942 the british raj tried to enlist all major political parties in support of the war effort congress led by nehru and gandhi demanded immediate independence and full control by congress of all of india that demand was rejected by the british and congress opposed the war effort with its quit india campaign the raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national regional and local congress leaders for the duration attlee did not object by contrast the muslim league led by muhammad ali jinnah and also the sikh community strongly supported the war effort they greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from london for their decision attlee retained a fondness for congress and until 1946 accepted their thesis that they were a nonreligious party that accepted hindus muslims sikhs and everyone else\\nthe muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the muslims of india and by 1946 attlee had come to agree with them with violence escalating in india after the war but with british financial power at a low ebb largescale military involvement was impossible viceroy wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed no divisions were available independence was the only option given the demands of the muslim league independence implied a partition that set off heavily muslim pakistan from the main portion of india\\nafter becoming prime minister in 1945 attlee originally planned to give india dominion status in 1948 but in the event the labour government gave full independence to india and pakistan in 1947 historian andrew roberts says the independence of india was a national humiliation but it was necessitated by urgent financial administrative strategic and political needs churchill in 19401945 had tightened the hold on india and imprisoned the congress leadership with attlees approval labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like canada or australia many of the congress leaders in the india had studied in england and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by labour leaders attlee was the labour expert on india and took special charge of decolonisation attlee found that churchills viceroy field marshal wavell was too imperialistic too keen on military solutions and too neglectful of indian political alignments the new viceroy was lord mountbatten the dashing war hero and a cousin of the king the boundary between the newly created states of pakistan and india involved the widespread resettlement of millions of muslims and hindus and many sikhs extreme violence ensued when punjab and bengal provinces were split historian yasmin khan estimates that between a halfmillion and a million men women and children were killed gandhi himself was assassinated by a hindu activist in january 1948\\nattlee also sponsored the peaceful transition to independence in 1948 of burma myanmar and ceylon sri lanka\\npalestine\\none of the most urgent problems concerned the future of the palestine mandate it had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle british policies there were perceived by the zionist movement and the truman administration as proarab and antijewish in the face of an armed revolt of jewish militant groups and increasing resistance from the local arab population britain had found itself unable to control events this was a very unpopular commitment and the evacuation of british troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to the united nations was widely supported by the british public\\nafrican colonies\\nthe governments policies with regard to the other colonies particularly those in africa focused on keeping them as strategic cold war assets while modernising their economies the labour party had long attracted aspiring leaders from africa and had developed elaborate plans before the war implementing them overnight with an empty treasury proved too challenging a major military base was built in kenya and the african colonies came under an

party bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954 one of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of herbert morrison whom attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons at one time attlee had favoured aneurin bevan to succeed him as leader but this became problematic after bevan almost irrevocably split the party\\nin

stances sanford resorted to only minor criticisms of his opponents voter turnout in the may primary broke all previous records for turnout in state primary elections sanford placed first with 269563 votes lake placed second with 181692 votes and both larkins and seawell earned less than 20 percent of the votes\\nin declaring that he would contest sanford in the democratic primary runoff lake

hostility saying lets get this straight right now on the race issuei have been and will continue to oppose to the end domination or direction by the naacp professor lake is bringing on integration when he stirs this up i dont believe in playing race against race or group against group he further accused lake of attempting to secure support by ruining race relations and assured that he could stave off federallymandated integration whereas lake would generate a confrontation that would hasten it he also attacked lakes professional background insisting i was raised around the cotton patches and tobacco fields of scotland county and i know how to handle the racial situation better than a theoretical college professor he contended that lakes focus on racial matters distracted from the more

provided critical leadership to his campaign and lined up key support behind him sanford was also innovative in the use of media consultants and polling data being the first north carolinian gubernatorial candidate to hire a pollster and prolifically use television advertisements he ran as a progressive but tried to avoid being labeled too liberal on issues of race businessmen and professionals who feared that lakes positions on race would be unfavorable to north carolinas economy backed sanford sanford ultimately won the june 27 democratic primary with a large lead earning 352133 votes in contrast to lakes 275905 lake subsequently pledged his support to sanford but did little to assist his campaign in the upcoming general election sanfords victory over lake in the 1960 gubernatorial election was one of two instances in which a racial moderate defeated a staunch segregationist in a southern statewide race between 1957 and 1973\\nmeanwhile preparations were underway for the 1960 democratic national convention in july while most southern politicians declared their support for senator lyndon b johnson of texas for the partys nomination in the 1960 united states

the north carolina democratic delegation than any other southern state but angering hodges and some of his own supporters and stoking division in the state democratic party kennedy ultimately secured the nomination and welcomed johnson into his campaign as the vice presidential nominee\\nsanford faced a strong opponent for the governors race in robert l gavin a moderate conservative republican attorney gavin denounced sanford as a tool of the liberal leadership of the national democratic party and organized labor although his reputation had been harmed by his early endorsement of kennedy sanford enthusiastically campaigned for the two of them he attacked gavin for contradicting himself on several occasions and for displaying a lack of familiarity with certain issues in the november election both kennedy and sanford won the offices they sought kennedy won the popular vote in north carolina by a small but solid margin sanford won with 543 percent of the vote 131000 votes over gavin but his performance was lackluster for a democrat seeking state office at the time sanford remained proud of his gubernatorial victory for the rest of his life feeling he had defeated a racist candidate lake and avenged grahams loss in 1950 out of appreciation for sanfords contribution to his campaign kennedy appointed hodges to his cabinet as united states secretary of commerce sanford

high school classes and had the lowest average number of years of education among its residents in the united states sanford believed that improved statewide education would raise north carolinas low average wages in his inaugural address he affirmed his wish to increase spending for the purpose saying if it takes more taxes to give our children this quality education we must face that fact and provide the money we must never lose sight of the fact that our children are our best investment this is no age for the faint of heart sanford spent the first few months of his time in office lobbying for a legislative plan to increase state spending on education\\nthe centerpiece of sanfords education platform was the quality education program which called for a 22 increase in average teacher pay 33 more funds for instructional supplies and a 100 increase in school library money sanford initially had difficulty figuring out how to fund his proposal as the state already levied comparatively high income and corporate taxes and a luxury tax on goods such as tobacco and soft drinks was likely to upset much of the populace many other elected state officials were fiscally conservative and were likely to oppose any significant borrowing of money and raising debts thus at the end of february 1961 sanford decided to fund his proposals through the elimination of exemptions of the states 3 sales tax on certain goods including food and prescription drugs the advanced taxes were controversial and the conservative general assembly was hesitant to pass them into law upon the convening of the general assembly in march many legislators commented in private that the proposal was doomed to fail liberals and journalists criticized it as unfair to the poor who would be hurt the most by a tax on food despite these doubts sanford had the good faith of legislative leaders being friends with lieutenant governor harvey cloyd philpott and working on building a relationship with speaker of the state house of representatives joseph m hunt jr he appointed former state senator william copeland as his chief legislative aide who though a conservative who had opposed increased school appropriations in the past was wellacquainted with the general assembly and was prepared to loyally serve the governors interests\\nsanford promoted his plan through a series of rallies across the state one of which was broadcast on radio he argued that north carolina trailed most other states with respect to education and that the exemptions elimination was more acceptable than a 1 tax increase on all other items he also intensively lobbied state legislators inviting them to breakfast at the governors mansion and visiting them at the sir walter hotel where most of them stayed while the general assembly was in session aside from arguing for his program sanford granted political favors in exchange for support he also actively challenged his critics to think of a better way to fund the education plan members of the press and disgruntled liberals backed down when they realized that without the new levy the education expansions would have to be scaled down\\nsanfords effort was ultimately successful and the general assembly implemented his program and the taxes average teacher salaries for north carolina quickly rose from 39th to 32nd among the states and perpupil expenditures rose from 45th to 38th sanfords successful lobbying gained national attention he was subsequently invited to numerous events around the country to speak about his education plan and he visited thirty states the increase in taxes was nevertheless poorly received in north carolina and resulted in a backlash in november 1961 the electorate rejected 10 state bond proposals in a referendumthe first time a bond had been turned down since 1924and a public opinion poll found that three fifths of the population disapproved of sanfords performance as governor the referendum defeat demoralized greatly sanfords staff though upset with the outcome and unapologetic in supporting the bonds sanford insisted on moving past the failure and focusing his attention elsewhere in the 1962 elections the democrats lost seats in the state house of representatives sanford was disappointed but he remained convinced that the tax proposal was the best way to fund his program and refused to heed calls to alter it\\nin 1961 sanford also appointed a governors commission on education beyond the high school under the leadership of irving e carlyle the commission produced a set of proposals in august 1962 aimed at increasing college enrollment in north carolina one of its recommendations was the consolidation of the states public junior colleges and industrial education centers under a single system of community colleges in may 1963 the general assembly responded by creating a department of community colleges under the state board of education sanford conceived the idea for the governors school of north carolina a publicly funded sixweek residential summer program for gifted high school students in the state he established the north carolina school of the arts to keep talented students in the fields of music drama the dance and allied performing arts at both the high school and college levels of instruction in their home state he convinced the general assembly to pass the measure to found the institution through logrolling and the promises of appointments to state offices\\nsanfords policies ultimately resulted in the neardoubling of north carolinas expenditures on public schools and the hiring of 2800 additional teachers however he struggled to ensure the states educational funding maintained parity with other states and matched with inflation despite convincing the legislature to appropriate an additional 50 million towards public schools during the 1963 session by the end of his tenure north carolinas national rankings in educational expenditures had fallen\\nnorth carolina fund\\nfeeling that his education program had spent most of his political capital in the legislature sanford began seeking private support to fund antipoverty efforts in north carolina while traveling across the state to promote his education plan sanford came to be of the belief that much of the poverty in north carolina was due to racial discrimination and the lack of economic opportunity for blacks he thus concluded that any antipoverty plan he created would have to address economic problems for both blacks and whites in the summer of 1962 he met john ehle a novelist and professor whom he quickly took on as an adviser on public policy with ehle he met with leaders of the ford foundation a private philanthropic organization and discussed a variety of issues with them including antipoverty efforts he also established contact with george esser an academic at uncchapel hills institute of government to ask him for potential uses of ford foundation funds in combating poverty sanfords aides organized a threeday tour of north carolina in january 1963 for ford foundation leaders to convince them to fund an antipoverty project sanfords attempts to devise a plan became increasingly urgent over the following months as civil rights activists intensified their calls for racial equality and the prospects of a white backlash grew he worked to secure the support of the z smith reynolds foundation and the mary reynolds babcock foundation two smaller north carolina philanthropic organizations to bolster proposed grants from the ford foundation and tapped the advice of john h wheeler leader of the black business community in durham he also invited officials from the us department of health education and welfare to come to north carolina to work on coordinating federal efforts with the state project\\nin july 1963 the ford foundation committed 7 million to support an antipoverty project in north carolina with additional grants from the other foundations on july 18 sanford wheeler charlie babcock a board member of the mary reynolds babcock foundation and c a mcknight the editor of the charlotte observer incorporated the north carolina fund its goals were to fight poverty and promote racial equality across the state since the north carolina fund was backed by private organizations and not financed by the state it could be more flexible in addressing social issues while also avoiding political opposition from segregationists sanford was made chairman of the funds board he publicly announced its creation at a press conference on september 30 garnering a positive reception from state newspapers the organisation had a racially integrated staffwhich was unusual at the timeand consulted the local residents it aimed to assist the fund launched a program that utilized team teaching and provided for teacher aides which was studied by president johnsons administration and used as a model for head start the fund also supported eleven additional antipoverty programs under another initiative which included the establishment of day care facilities and job training courses these were also evaluated by the johnson administration when it developed its war on poverty programs sanford himself was disappointed by johnsons war on poverty and the agency responsible for it the office of economic opportunity and told federal officials that the goal of their effort should not be to eliminate povertywhich sanford thought impossibleas much as it should be to reduce the causes of poverty johnson administration officials considered placing sanford in charge of the office the fund ceased operations in 1969\\nrace relations and civil rights\\nat the time sanford entered gubernatorial office the state of racial affairs in north carolina was essentially the same as it had been since the early 1900s segregation was common despite token integration efforts in some urban schools and state colleges 99 percent of black school children attended segregated schools and though federal courts had mandated the integration of buses and trains transit stations and most other accommodationshotels restaurants movie theaters public parks and beachesremained segregated according to the north carolina advisory commission on civil rights only 312 percent of potential nonwhite voters were registered to vote in contrast to 902 percent of white voters in his inaugural address sanford appealed for mutual respect and understanding between races and said that no group of our citizens can be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of firstclass citizenship he enrolled his daughter betsee and his son terry in the integrated murphy school it was attended by a single black student an action which received attention in the state and national press\\nsanford had considered racism to be immoral since he was student at the university of north carolina but initially wished to avoid dealing with issues of racial equality directly as governor viewing it as a distraction from his main platform and politically dangerous he had no planned strategy or agenda for the issue however he soon felt that as governor he had to take some action to address the growing tension in the united states due to the increasing activity of the civil rights movement shortly after taking office he began appointing black professionals to state offices ultimately he placed over three dozen blacks on state boards commissions and committees he also consulted black community and business leaders on civil rights issues such as wheeler sociologist john r larkins and real estate developer john w winters winters was particularly insistent on encouraging sanford and his staff to reconsider their views on civil rights in 1961 sanford and the chairman of the board of conservation and development skipper bowles decided to integrate north carolinas state parks sanford generally believed that the use of persuasion and appeals to decency instead of invoking the law and employing force would mollify segregationists and lead to social change he thought that the basic goodness of people would prevail in racial matters and was often disappointed to encounter hostility from north carolinians opposed to desegregation\\nin may 1961 a multiracial group of civil rights activists known as freedom riders prepared to enter north carolina on intercity buses to ensure the desegregation of them and related transit facilities in the south sanford sought the advice of thomas j pearsall an attorney who had previously developed north carolinas response to federally mandated school desegregation pearsall counselled sanford to approach the matter quietly informally and without public notice and be prepared to deploy the state highway patrol to meet mob violence under sanfords orders the highway patrol monitored the buses movements and guarded against potential violence from angry segregationist whites throughout his tenure sanford would deploy state police at civil rights demonstrations to maintain order and deter violence but he never used them to disperse demonstrators he later said it was up to us to keep the order and let them demonstrate which was constitutional it was unthinkable to put them in jail for that he also expressed support for president kennedys actions to maintain order during the integration of the university of mississippi sanford remained conscious of the desires of the white constituency which had elected him and in one instance wrote federal officials to request that a group of white north carolinian army reservists be reassigned from the predominantly black army unit to which they were posted sanford let the matter drop after the united states department of defense refused to honor his request journalists often wrote about sanfords actions regarding racial issues and dubbed him a leading moderate he enjoyed the media attention but shied away from being portrayed as party to a conflict with the souths more hardline segregationist governors\\nsanfords cautious stance on civil rights and racial issues began to change while he traveled across north carolina to visit schools to promote his education program sanford visited both white and black schools and while touring them encouraged the students to pursue their own education as means of securing economic prosperity in the future over time he grew uncomfortable saying this to black schoolchildren and on one occasion after a meeting with black students he felt ill and refused to eat dinner he later explained his trouble saying i had the sickening feeling that every time i talked to them i was saying words that were a mockeryi was talking about opportunities that i knew and i feared they knew didnt exist no matter how hard they might work in school sanford was also moved to reconsider his views after investigating the source of financial support for black college students who remained in raleigh during the summer after the end of their academic semester to protest segregation he wrote i was amazed to discover that their support came from the local older negroincredibly these local older negroes had been dissatisfied all the timeand they were intensively if secretly proud of the young negroes who were militantly insisting on change\\nonce resolved that he had to take more action to support racial equality sanford began making statements in favor of it in october 1962 he told a gathering of methodists in rutherford county that poverty in north carolina was worsened by the lack of economic opportunity for blacks and told the audience that whites would have to handle the difficult problems of race in a spirit of christian fellowship the address drew a mediocre response from the crowd and generated little attention in the state media in early 1963 he began drafting a speech entitled observations for a second century which directly called for the support of civil rights sanford shared his work with over 100 of his associates most were supportive of his aims but others feared the consequences his statement would have on the democratic party on january 18 1963 sanford delivered his address at the carolina inn before the north carolina press association after making an aside to the journalists sanford delved into his prepared remarks\\nthe statement made sanford the first southern governor to call for the end of racially discriminatory employment the same day sanford announced the creation of the good neighbor council a biracial panel aimed at developing voluntary nondiscriminatory hiring practices and encouraging youth to prepare for gainful employment the council did not have any provision to enforce its recommendations and thus its impact was minimal sanford also requested that the heads of state agencies adopt nondiscriminatory hiring policies and supported a bill that reduced racial barriers in the north carolina national guard ultimately sanfords attempts at reform did not significantly alter employment dynamics in the state and only benefited a minority of blacks the racial integration of public schools also made little progress during his tenure\\nmany young black people felt sanford was not doing enough to address their concerns in may 1963 500 black student demonstrators gathered on the lawn of the governors mansion and chanted for the governor to come out sanford who was hosting a black tie fundraising event for the north carolina symphony stepped onto the south porch of the house he stood annoyed as the protesters jeered him before saying ill be glad to talk to you about any of your problems any of your grievances any of your hopes this is not the time or the place he also added if you want to talk to me at any time about your plans and your problems let my office know you have not come to me with any requests when one of the demonstrators yelled that sanford should have already been aware of their grievances without any specific requests sanford responded im not dictator son youre in a democracy the group booed him and eventually left the premises\\nin late may and early june four hundred black students from north carolina agricultural and technical college in greensboro were arrested for breaking segregationist practices in cafeterias and movie theaters sanford arranged for their release and had them returned to the college campus later in june he summoned 150 black civic leaders to the north carolina state capitol where he told them that he would not let mass demonstrations destroy us he told them that their enemy was not white people instead it was a system bequeathed to us by a cotton economy kindled by stubbornness intolerance hotheadedness north and south exploding into war and leaving to our generation the ashes of vengeance retribution and poverty the way to fight this common enemy is education in early july sanford convened a meeting of over 200 municipal officials and established a mayors coordinating committee to address civil rights concerns\\nin january 1964 james farmer and floyd mckissick of the congress of racial equality demanded that the city of chapel hill already one of the most integrated communities in the state fully desegregate by february 1 or face a wave of demonstrations sanford released a statement of reproach towards the ultimatum and promised municipal officials his support he later said i felt that i had been pushed around long enough the following month activists went through with their protests heightening local tensions and resulting in numerous arrests sanford hosted farmer and mckissick at the governors mansion in an attempt to broker a solution but the situation was not resolved until a local committee reached an agreement between the demonstrators and municipal officials\\nhandling the ku klux klan\\nduring sanfords tenure activities of the white supremacist ku klux klan in north carolina rapidly increased sanford requested information on the klan from the fbi when the reports were found to be insufficient and unsatisfactory he arranged for an undercover agent of the fbi working in the north carolina division of motor vehicles to infiltrate the organization in the eastern portion of the state several months later the fbi announced that north carolina had one of the largest klan membership in the country\\nin june 1964 an interracial group of students traveled to elm city to renovate a local africanamerican church members of the united klans of america confronted the youths who promptly left the state when a larger interracial group arrived to complete the work 250 klansmen marched into the town and two of them attempted to burn the church down on june 22 sanford issued a statement referring to antiklan legislation and saying because there is a growing concern across the state i think it is necessary to remind the people involved that the ku klux klan is not going to take over north carolina\\nsanford condemned the klans methods and ordered the state highway patrol to assist the municipal police in protecting the church and maintaining order his staff quietly brokered a compromise convincing the local pastor to accommodate the white volunteers in a hotel instead of local black residents homes thereby avoiding the racial mixing of which the klansmen disapproved state authorities dealt with members of the klan in a similarly accommodating manner throughout the rest of sanfords tenure allowing the organization to strengthen its position in the region in response to sanfords criticism of their actions in elm city klansmen burnt a cross on the lawn of the governors mansion in midaugust sanford inspected the cross later commenting it is a badge of honor to have such hoodlums against you but it is a mark of shame for the state of north carolina to have such childish activities going on in december when the klan threatened businessmen who had sponsored interracial christmas parades he encouraged its members to read the christmas story and the message of goodwill towards all men contained in the bible and declared that if there are any illegal acts on the part of the ku klux klan they will be prosecuted\\nlater tenure\\nit was rumored by kennedys personal secretary evelyn lincoln that kennedy had considered removing johnson as vice president from his electoral ticket in the 1964 presidential election and replacing him with sanford sanford later dismissed these rumors feeling that such an action was not politically advantageous and would have damaged kennedys election prospects in the south presidential adviser larry obrien also dismissed the notion that johnson would be replaced\\nkennedy was assassinated on november 22 1963 sanford was in winstonsalem when he heard that the president had been shot he directed his driver to take him back to the governors mansion in raleigh and along the way he learned that kennedy had died his office issued a brief statement calling the event overwhelming sanford rarely spoke of kennedys assassination in his later years and preferred to avoid discussion of it when the subject arose he felt that it had changed the world and negatively impacted the united states he and his family attended kennedys state funeral in washington dc the assassination came at a time when sanford had been lobbying kennedy to consider locating a large environmental research center in north carolina the decision then fell to johnson who succeeded kennedy as president of the united states and had to consider pressure from other politicians that wanted the facility in their own respective states\\nsanfords racial policies upset north carolinas white populace though he was able to contain white backlash throughout his administration during the 1964 north carolina gubernatorial election l richardson preyer a supporter of sanford faced conservative dan k moore in the democratic primary election sanford had originally wanted lieutenant governor philpott to succeed him but philpott had unexpectedly died in august 1961 he instead endorsed preyer while lake endorsed moore at the same time johnson was running for election as president of the united states and sanford actively supported him the gubernatorial contest devolved into a de facto referendum on sanfords tenure particularly his handling of race matters and moore secured the nomination lake dubbed the outcome a popular rejection of sanfords service sanford felt betrayed by civil rights leaders since he thought that their insistence on continuing demonstrations in chapel hill had aggravated white resentment and damaged preyers electoral prospects\\nanticipating that moore and his allies would attempt to dismantle some of his initiatives upon assuming office sanford spent the last six months of his term trying to ensure the protection of his projects he invited moores wife jeanelle c moore into the board of trustees of the north carolina school of the arts and placed one of moores top aides on the board of the north carolina fund he also transferred a summer internship program for college students interested in state politics out of the governors office and into uncs institute of government\\neven as he was preparing to leave office sanford felt that he had much more work to accomplish he urged the research triangle institute to study affordable housing proposals and established a commission to plan for the future of development and growth in the piedmont crescent region he traveled to washington dc to have his official portrait made and then went to new york to present jackie kennedy with north carolinas financial contribution to the construction of the kennedy library in early december sanford commuted the sentences of several chapel hill protesters shortly before leaving office in january 1965 he reached a deal with the johnson administration for the 25 million environmental research facility to be located at the research triangle park reflecting on the impending end of his term he expressed regret that more black employees had not been hired by the state and that he had not done enough to promote prison reform in his final publicly broadcast address as governor he asserted if our weapon against poverty and bigotry is education we can conquer all battles and make north carolina a leader of all the rest of the nation he was succeeded as governor of north carolina by moore on january 8 1965\\nimmediate postgubernatorial career\\nsanford enjoyed his time as governor but by the time his term was over he was very unpopular in north carolina after leaving office he returned to fayetteville and opened a new law firm in raleigh with some of his former colleagues in 1966 he published but what about the people a book about his tenure as governor the following year he released storm over the states a study of the role of state governments in handling american public issues\\nsanford was quietly disappointed with moores tenure as governor as moore took little interest in furthering his predecessors initiatives in 1967 he mulled over the possibility of challenging conservative democrat sam ervin for his us senate seat the two men disliked each other sanford thought of ervin as a constitutional racist who delayed national progress on civilrights issues while ervin remained bitter about sanfords early support for kennedy in 1960 though he had spoken about the inferiority of a senate seat as compared to the governorship sanford was encouraged by his chances at a bid as discontent over the sales tax on food had faded and his favorability ratings improved he ultimately decided against it after concluding that the contest would divide the democratic party and he would lose on account of his civil rights positions he then agreed to serve as president johnsons campaign manager in the 1968 presidential election just before johnsons withdrawal on march 31 he subsequently declined an offer from robert f kennedy to assist his presidential campaign vice president hubert humphrey then became the presumptive democratic nominee for president and considered including sanford on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate sanford attended the 1968 democratic national convention and delivered the speech seconding humphreys nomination for the partys endorsement he was embittered by the disdain with which the delegates treated the outgoing president johnson and disapproved of humphreys choice of senator edmund muskie of maine for as his vice presidential candidate during the convention sanford called johnson to wish him a happy birthday the president offered to appoint him united states secretary of agriculture for the last few months of his term but sanford declined sanford subsequently served as chairman for the citizens for humphreymuskie committee and in that position helped fundraise for humphreys campaign and encouraged the candidate to break from johnsons views on the controversial vietnam war humphrey lost the election to republican richard nixon\\npresident of duke university\\nselection\\nin 1969 the private duke university in durham north carolina was wracked by a wave of student unrest over the vietnam war and civil rights issues unable to contain the situation university president douglas knight resigned and the board of trustees began searching for a new president trustee molly brian recommended that the board consider sanford as she had known him when he chaired the board of trustees for methodist college the idea gained traction among the board and the universitys presidential search committee sanford heard rumors of his consideration and though he thought he would like the job believed it was unlikely that it would ultimately be offered to him during this time he focused on work at his law firm while turning down several prospective private sector positions as he wanted to keep his options open in case he wanted to run for public office again in late october 1969 the search committee officially contacted sanford and began discussing how he would approach the job on december 13 the committee informed sanford that he had been chosen for the presidency he assumed the responsibilities of the job on april 2 1970 and was officially inaugurated in a ceremony on october 17 1970 as president he lived in the douglas m and grace knight house on his first day as university president sanford removed a cap on jewish enrollment allowing the number of jewish students to significantly increase over the following years\\nfinances\\nwhen sanford assumed the universitys presidency he sought to improve the schools status at the time it was experiencing a budget deficit and suffered from a small endowment seeking to increase donations he sought to increase the schools enrollment from north carolinian public school students and private school students from elsewhere he hired croom beatty a boarding school fundraiser as associate director for admissions and tasked him with finding children at private schools who came from wealthy backgrounds croom would canvas the private schools for such students and if he determined that their enrollment at duke would financially benefit the university he would recommend sanford personally review their applicationeven if they had earned lower grades or test scores sanford also personally recommended the consideration of applications from children of prospective donors who he had learned of from various contacts he also directed baseball coach tom butters to spend the summer of 1970 fundraising and sought out north carolinian alumni to ask for their financial support\\nrelationship with the student body\\nsanford helped quell student unrest over the vietnam war early in his tenure as university president addressing the protests of the 1970 kent state shootings with tolerance choosing to not call in police to clear the roads leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that west campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring shortly before his tenure on february 13 1969 60 student members of the afroamerican society had occupied dukes main administration center the allen building demanding the creation of a black studies program after three days of clashes with police they left the building peaceably february 16 when school officials agreed to the program during his tenure sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions he criticized vice president spiro agnews criticism of student protestors in a the new york times oped writing the deep troubles of our society do not begin on college campuses are not bred there and are not centered there instead our possibilities for resolving these troubles find their greatest hope on college campuses\\nsanford sought to increase student involvement in the running of the university and hired upperclassmen to work in his office as assistants and researchers he also designated students to serve as greeters and guides for visiting dignitaries and held social meetings with incoming freshman at his house eventually known as tea with terry from before his tenure students had complained about a lack of representation on the university board of trustees and after some students refused to leave an early trustee meeting he negotiated a deal with them whereby they would leave but a reporter from the student newspaper the chronicle would stay to report on the proceedings and a committee would be formed to consider making the meetings public the committee later agreed to the idea and in late 1970 sanford recommended a student representative be designated to sit with the board the radical students on campus were surprised by his accommodating style duke graduate and local journalist mark pinksy told the new york times hes just plain smarter than the radicals are hes coopted the hell out of them\\nregional issues and economic and government reform\\nin the fall of 1970 sanford permitted duke students leave to participate in congressional campaigns that election season numerous new south governors were elected across the southern united states including dale bumpers in araknsas reubin askew in florida john c west in south carolina and jimmy carter in georgia sanford held a grudge against carter for using racebaiting tactics to defeat his friend carl sanders in the democratic primary these new governors mostly avoided racial rhetoric in office and advocated for governmental reform triggering renewed national interest in the region in a speech in may 1971 the souths time has come after a century of being the whipping boy and the backward child  the south can lead the nation must lead the nationand all the better because the nation has never been in greater need of leadership sanford suggested that the southern states act in concert in their efforts to resolve regional issues he proposed that a regional body be established to assist in coordinating growth and economic development in the south working with academics he assisted in the foundation of the southern growth policies board on december 16 1971 \\nin 1971 sanford also recruited joel fleischman one of his former aides in the governors office to come to duke and establish a school for public policy fleishman created the institute of policy studies and public affairs in january 1972\\nin july 1979 sanford began a yearlong sabbatical and used the time to write a danger of democracy a book which proposed reforming political parties presidential nomination processes\\nnixon presidential library\\nin 1981 sanford entertained the idea of location nixons presidential library and museum at duke where it could become a center of research and bolster the universitys reputation sanford raised the subject with nixon during a visit to the former president at nixons new york city office on july 28 1981 and the former president was receptive to the idea while sanford tried to win over the faculty to his ideamany of whom disliked nixon and were worried about his scandalridden reputation damaging the universitythe media began reporting that duke was a prospective site for the library opposition from professors mounted as they expressed concerns that the museum would become little more than a monument to nixon while the most sensitive and valuable documents of his public career would not be kept in the library some called for sanfords resignation\\nseveral dozen faculty supported sanfords initiative but in response to the controversy he modified his proposal to have the library located at the research triangle park with the support of other regional university leaders the plan quickly fell apart after the faculty of other universities began declaring their opposition to it and sanford began to feel embarrassed by the affair the duke academic council a governing body representing the universitys faculty voted to eliminate the museum from the offer and scale down the planned size of the library discouraged nixon declined sanfords offer and established his library in yorba linda california\\nsanford officially resigned on july 4 1985 he was succeeded by h keith h brodie his preferred successor\\nconcurrent political activities\\nupon being invested as president of duke sanford told a new york times reporter that he had decided against any staterelated political responsibilities through 1972 but had not pledged similarly about a national office saying i wont campaign for it but ive never made a shermanlike statement that i wouldnt accept it privately he maintained contact with some of his former political acquaintances such as bennett but felt that if he became too politically involved the board of trustees would fire him sanford believed that nixon would be reelected to the united states presidency and ruled out the possibility of seeking the democratic nomination in the 1972 presidential primary that january several duke students approached him to request his assent to a petition to put his name on the democratic ballot they felt that the slate of candidates in the primary was weak sanford himself thought senator edmund muskiewho was gaining endorsements from party stalwartswas an unremarkable candidate and was worried that liberals were uniting behind senator george mcgovern and had encouraged humphrey to reseek nomination\\nsanford figured that the board of trustees would solve his dilemma by forcing him to stop the petition drive the board argued over the affair but ultimately decided to let sanford launch a candidacy his friends thought a presidential campaign was illadvised and north carolina governor bob scottwho had already pledged his support to muskiewas angered when he learned of sanford possibly entering the race sanford claimed to have firmly decided to contest the nomination after seeing muskies public reaction to the canuck letter according to biographers howard e covington jr and marion ellis if there was anything that moved sanford to make the leap in 1972 it was probably his desire to challenge wallace and show the nation that all southern politicians were not demagogues george wallace was the governor of alabama and an avowed racial segregationist sanford felt that wallace did not truly believe in segregation and employed racebaiting tactics as an opportunity to gain votes he later said of wallace i always thought george was just a pure hypocrite  george saw it as just a great game just another issue to be played and he played it the way it was an advantage to play it he publicly declared his candidacy for the democratic nomination on march 8 he stated his intention to stay on dukes campus and campaign on the weekends aim to get the support of 100 delegates before the democratic convention\\nsome media response was positive but the press was generally skeptical of sanfords candidacy among the others competing in the north carolina primary were wallace senator henry m jackson and congresswoman shirley chisholm sanford struggled to gain media attention and ran on a platform of eliminating tax loopholes for rich people establishing price controls on food increasing social security payments by 25 percent supporting equal rights for women creating a national health insurance plan and devolution of power from the federal government to the states while focusing most of his efforts on north carolina he also built a small national campaign organization he also visited former president johnson at his ranch in texas and received a 500 campaign donation one poll showed wallace in first place in north carolina with 33 percent of the vote and sanford with 28 percent the latter was encouraged but anxious that chisholm would draw away black voters he needed to overcome wallace on the night before the election he conducted a television appearance where voters asked him questions about his platform responding to a question about the seriousness of his candidacy for the presidency or if he was seeking a position to bargain for another office he said id rather be president of duke university than vice president and furthermore id rather be unemployed than be in the cabinet\\nwallace won the north carolina with over 40 percent of the total securing 408000 votes sanford received 304000 while chisholm got 61000 sanfords friend sam poole said that the loss was really a very low point in his life despite the setback he decided to continue his campaign to the convention in miami he managed only a fifthplace finish with 775 delegate votes behind mcgovern 186495 jackson 525 wallace 3817 and chisholm 15195\\nundeterred sanford began preparations two years later for a run for the 1976 democratic presidential nomination announcing his candidacy on june 1 1975 he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of duke while he developed a following among educators he did not have a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year then while campaigning in massachusetts in january he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart murmur on january 25 sanford withdrew from the primaries the first democrat to do so that year sanford was left near bankruptcy by his abortive candidacy though his friend paul vick later assisted him in managing his finances and recouping some of his wealth he thereafter refocused his time on running the university and in 1977 he rejected president jimmy carters offer to appoint him united states ambassador to france\\nin 1984 former democratic governor jim hunt challenged republican incumbent jesse helms for a seat in the us senate sanford considered challenging helms himself but resolved that hunt should make the bid as it was his time sanford initially advised hunts campaign warning him not to engage in the negative campaigning that helms employed hunt eventually embraced this

government sanford hoped to propose an alternative solution to the conflict based upon the marshall plan in february 1986 sanford and senator chris dodd traveled to central america to study the issue at the same time president oscar arias of costa rica was hosting a multilateral conference with representatives of nearby countries troubled by the conflict in nicaragua sanford proposed to arias that after the war ended a multinational working group be created to plan for economic redevelopment of the region arias was receptive to the idea and soon after sanford returned to the united states he delivered his first major speech before the senate supporting a resolution commending arias initiatives to host negotiations and end the nicaraguan civil war the resolution passed 97 votes to one in

role in its creation he repeatedly returned to central america to tour nicaragua and observe arias peace process\\nthe commission published its report in 1989 recommending action taken to ensure human rights and the fulfillment economic necessities of the regions population the document was endorsed by five central american presidents sanford believed the commissions work hastened the end of the contra war and reoriented local focus on economic recovery reflecting i consider it the most significant thing i did in washington nicaraguan president daniel ortega personally thanked sanford for his efforts and he was commended by his senate colleagues bob dole and john kerry sanford proposed a bill to appropriate federal funds to the commissions use but it was not acted upon for years and was challenged by helms who sought to attach statements to it calling on central america to embrace free enterprise initiatives sanford found helms actions irksome and though his bill finally passed the senate in september 1991 the money it appropriated was never handed over\\nsanford kept a journal during his senate tenure and often wrote about his irritation with the bodys deference to member seniority instead of better ideas the existence of incomprehensible legislative rules and jurisdictional feuds between committee chairs he also perceived an increase in partisanship and a diminishing willingness for compromise he strongly disapproved of helms writing i think his service in the senate has been largely of zero value to north carolinahe has a negative attitude about everything and it is very difficult to find anything up here that he has done that has any lasting value the two usually maintained cordial relations though in one instance helms angrily denounced sanford to the press after the latter made a joke at helms expense during a committee hearing helms later apologized\\nfrom early on in his tenure sanford was troubled by the reagan administrations growing deficit spending and congress toleration of it he crafted an honest budget bill that mandated a balanced budget introduced taxes to increase revenue and separated the social security trust fund from other

lost the election to republican george h w bush and democrats performed poorly in north carolina elections leaving sanford as the leading elected north carolina democrat in the contests aftermath he increasingly bemoaned the leftward lean of the national democratic party objecting to ron browns assumption of the chair of the democratic national committee and expressing concern that the democrats were perceived by far too many people as being the black mans party thus losing support from moderate whites sanford wrote in his journal that the lingering race prejudice does indeed drive a great many white people away from the democratic party\\nsanford was initially hopeful that he could influence policy with the incoming bush administration but quickly tired of bush becoming outraged with his nomination of john tower as secretary of defense and upset within his viewbushs focus on trivial affairs meant to garner him shortterm electoral support rather than provide longterm benefit to the country following the supreme courts decision to overturn the conviction of a man who had burned a united states flag as an act of protest bush and congressional republicans proposed a flag desecration amendment to the united states constitution that would make it illegal for a person to burn american flags sanford thought bush was pursuing a demagogic votegetting lowprincipled course andthough he personally disagreed with flag burninghe thought that such an amendment ran contrary to the ideals of political freedom included in the bill of rights on october 17 1989 sanford delivered a speech in the senate on the issue saying that a prohibition of flag burning diminished the right to protest and weakened the bill of rights he thought the speech was the best of his time in the senate and once he finished john danforth a cosponsor of the amendment rose to say he had not thoughtfully considered the implications of the measure and would vote against it the amendment ultimately failed to garner the necessary support of twothirds of the body to pass\\nby 1990 sanford began having doubts about his future and about running for reelection reflecting on his past four years in the

treatment of a heart valve infection this delayed his attempts to campaign but he returned to work in the senate in late july sanford was heavily involved in the direction of his campaign and pledged to tour all 100 north carolina counties early polling suggested he enjoyed a large lead over faircloth faircloth attacked sanford as beholden to special interests and an advocate of big government and higher taxes sanford countered by portraying his opponent as a conservative hardliner during a televised debate in september sanford countered faircloths accusations that he was a spendthrift by pointing to his efforts at budget reform\\nby october sanfords heart infection had grown more serious and he underwent surgery to replace the troubled valve temporarily preventing him from campaigning

using outofstate driving licenses as identification even though new hampshire residents are required to update their licenses in order to drive however new hampshire state law allows residents of the state who happen to have outofstate driving licenses to vote there are a number of reasons why some voters may use outofstate driving licenses with the most likely being that they are outofstate college students numerous legitimate new hampshire voters said that this was the case with them they were students at colleges in new hampshire who had yet to update their driving license new hampshire public radio also found that most instances of outofstate driving licenses being used were in college towns another reason is that they may be military personnel on active duty factcheckorg

cite a single other state that gives its secretary of state such authority by february 7 2017 kobach had filed nine cases and obtained six convictions all were regarding cases of double voting none would have been prevented by voter id laws one case was dropped the other two were still pending all six convictions involved older citizens including four white republican men and one woman who were

sheriff and county attorney of ellis county kansas learned of this and questioned kilian both concluded he had not intentionally broken the law and decided not to prosecute however when kobach got

southern poverty law center claim he overreaches on cases that district attorneys deemed not worth prosecuting and allege that he is motivated by racism in his 2020 us senate campaign kobach hired a

republican ron thornburgh from 2011 until the programs temporary suspension in early 2018 kobach oversaw its rapid expansion to 30 states\\nthe program was dogged with accusations of voter suppression enabled by its primitive data matching according to the new york times the program searches for double registrations using only voters first and last names and date of birth and it generates thousands of false matchesjohn smith in kansas can easily be confused with john smith in iowa due to its tendency to produce false matches the program could be implemented to suppress the vote and wrongly remove legitimate voters from voter rolls\\nthe large numbers of false positives produced by the program led to sensational and misleading headlines for example 35750 voters in the 2012 north carolina general election matched with voters with supposedly identical voters in other states but upon close investigation only eight cases of potential double voting were referred to prosecutors and two people were convicted a 2016 paper by researchers at stanford harvard yale and the university of pennsylvania found that if the program were fully implemented 200 legitimate voters may be impeded from voting for every double vote stopped by 2017 doubts over the accuracy of crosscheck had led four states to withdraw from the program\\nin 2017 researchers revealed that crosschecks massive database was poorly secured tech reporter dell cameron wrote in gizmodo it would be difficult to overstate crosschecks carelessness when it comes to handling voter records fourteen national security experts

by the current 125 state house members and those of 40 senators and found the partial ss numbers for 117 of the kansas house members and those of 34 senators as well as the numbers of former legislators in a separate instance the state of florida which had received social security numbers of hundreds of kansas voters from kobach in 2013 via participation in the crosscheck program made them publicly available in 2017 leading to the federally mandated suspension of the program after a lawsuit accused kobach of violating voters privacy rights\\nproof of citizenship requirement

voting being a problem a federal judge ordered kobach to register more than 18000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law in her ruling she wrote the court cannot find that the states interest in preventing noncitizens from voting in kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters the judge noted that there was only evidence of three noncitizens in kansas voting between 2003 and 2013\\na reuters analysis of the individuals on a suspense list found that more than 60 percent were age 25 or under they were clustered in the highpopulation areas of wichita topeka and the kansas city suburbs and the college towns of lawrence and manhattan 41 percent were unaffiliated 35 percent registered as democrats and 23 percent as republicans reuters

competing against kobach for the republican gubernatorial nomination said kobach should be required to personally pay those fees that had been awarded the response of the secretarys office was that kobach is shielded from any such liability kobach did pay a 1000 fine per judge robinsons order but he did so with a credit card belonging to a staff member who was detailed to ukraine with the us

passage\\ntreadwells opposition was based on concerns that the legislation in question would suppress voting in that demographic due to inherent difficulties for remote village residents in obtaining such identification for whom getting drivers licenses can be burdensome and which are not mandated to have photos treadwell said he had no recollection of ever talking to kobach directly about it although the subject had arisen in a roundtable discussion with nass convention attendees responding to a reporter he claimed he was unaware that kobach had testified in his state firmly rebutting the

suppression committee a preposterous joke stating that the commission was disbanded because it could not prove high rates of voter fraud in the united states toobin accused kobach of supporting

ago\\nkobach was credited with introducing the controversial tactic of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaires but it was thought his advocacy may have led to the supreme court ruling against the initiative as the trump administration informed the court that us secretary of commerce wilbur ross had initiated the divisive proposal joanna rodriguez the nrsc press secretary

questions\\nkobachs involvement with the 501c4 we build the wall wbtw has given cause for concern as the fundraising and campaign mailing lists it is accumulating are prohibited from coordinating with his senate campaign but the ability and appetite for effective oversight within the trump administration are anticipated to likely be inadequate on august 1 2019 kobach sent out a campaign fundraiser using both the corporate name and email list of wbtw donors common cause vice president for policy and litigation paul s ryan said at a minimum this kobach for senate fundraising solicitation email appears to violate the paid for by disclaimer requirement for official campaign communications ryan specified the requirement that mandates disclosure of the financial sponsors who originate official political communications kobachs email might be legal if his campaign paid fair market value for the use of wbtws list if that were the case a paid for by disclaimer would be required but was not present in the solicitation ryan said if the kobach committee did not pay fair market value for the cost of disseminating this email then the kobach committee has arguably committed the more serious campaign finance law violation of receiving a corporate contribution in the form of a coordinated expenditure we build the wall is legally prohibited from financing federal political campaigns in any fashion besides the concerns raised about kolfage himself a week prior to the mailer rightwing antiimmigrant wbtw board member and former congressman tom tancredo sat on the stage alongside kobach and endorsed him in a new mexico rally pushing the wall the kobach campaign said after common cause filed a formal complaint and request for an investigation into the apparent violations that it is a radical leftist organization that the complaint was without substance and this attack by common cause also includes a frivolous letter to the department of justice asking the department of justice to launch a pointless investigation this is also typical of common cause tactics and it is intended to cause distraction wherever conservative republicans are leading in important political campaigns\\non july 23 2019 kansas senate president susan wagle of wichita filed the paperwork with the federal elections commission necessary to run she criticized kobachs employment in his

hamilton said voters didnt have to choose between kobach who couldnt win and a moderate marshall in whose behest the state party leaders had urged senator wagle and lindstrom to drop out of the race objecting to the party pressure lindstrom characterized his opponents as shortsighted selfservingcareer politicians who are divisive controversial and have a record of losing elections wagle touted her own candidacy saying its very very important that we send a leader to the us senate who is articulate who is persuasive who other people respect im the one whos already debated barbara bollier i

united states supreme court heard arguments on april 23 2019 regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question the court affirmed the appeals rejecting the questions inclusion and it was felt kobachs initial advocacy of the initiative undermined the rationale of the census bureaus case\\nwhen asked by abc news about trumps claim that he trump had won the\\xa0popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally trump advisor kellyanne conway gave kobach as a source of the claim kobach later told reporters in kansas that i think the presidentelect is absolutely correct when he says the number of illegal votes cast exceeds the popularvote margin between him and hillary clinton pointing to a 2014 study led by jesse

kansas on weekends an assurance that he would be made secretary of homeland security by november 2019 a guarantee that he would be the administrations primary spokesman on immigration policy a guarantee that other cabinet secretaries whose positions relate to immigration would defer to him with trump mediating disputes as needed a sevenperson staff a security detail if necessary and the title of assistant to the president some trump administration officials were shocked by kobachs presumptuousness the position would not require senate confirmation trump however was certain kobach

certificate in 2009 kobach joked at a gop barbecue that obama and god had something in common because neither has a birth certificate kobach responded to criticism of the joke with lighten up its just a joke are they really suggesting it is forbidden to tell jokes about barack obama\\nin 2010 during his candidacy for the kansas secretary of state kobach said obama could end the controversy over his citizenship by producing a longform birth certificate in the preceding two years judges had termed such suits frivolous these included us district judge r barclay surrick of philadelphia who had thrown out a lawsuit on the issue saying it was a waste of the courts time kobach said that the certificate released by obama doesnt have a doctors signature on it  look until a court says otherwise

of obamas eligibility for the kansas ballot and after hawaii officials sent a note to kobach saying that obamas birth certificate was genuine kobach allowed obama to remain on the ballot and said that for me settles the issue\\nin 2016 kobach said that there are interesting things about the question of obamas citizenship that just made you scratch your head kobach said that obamas opposition to the kansas proof of citizenship requirement law was possibly because the president was not a citizen himself maybe thats why he doesnt talk about proof of citizenship because he you know he would rather

most of the iskra editors supported martov and the mensheviks while plekhanov supported lenin and the bolsheviks during 1903 and 1904 many members changed sides in the factions plekhanov soon parted ways with the bolsheviks trotsky left the mensheviks in september 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with lenin and the bolsheviks\\nfrom 1904 until 1917 trotsky described himself as a nonfactional social democrat he worked between 1904 and 1917 trying to reconcile different groups within the party which resulted in

betrayed by a secret police agent in may and trotsky had to flee to rural finland there he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution\\non 19 september 1905 the typesetters at the ivan sytins printing house in moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay by the evening of 24 september the workers at 50 other printing shops in moscow were also on strike on 2 october 1905 the typesetters in printing shops in saint petersburg decided to strike in support of the moscow strikers on 7 october 1905 the railway workers of the moscowkazan railway went out on strike amid the resulting confusion trotsky returned from finland to saint petersburg on 15 october 1905 on that day trotsky spoke before the saint petersburg soviet council of workers deputies which was meeting at the technological institute in the city also attending were some 200000 people crowded outside to hear the speechesabout half of all workers in saint petersburg\\nafter his return trotsky and parvus took over the newspaper russian gazette increasing its circulation to 500000 trotsky also cofounded together with parvus and julius martov and other mensheviks nachalo the beginning which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of saint petersburg in 1905\\njust before trotskys return the mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that trotsky had an elected nonparty revolutionary organization representing the capitals workers the first soviet council of workers by the time of trotskys arrival the saint petersburg soviet was already functioning headed by khrustalyevnosar georgy nosar alias pyotr khrustalyov khrustalyevnosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the saint petersburg soviet khrustalevnosar was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the soviet\\nhowever since his election he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the bolsheviks original opposition to him khrustalevnosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the saint petersburg soviet indeed to the outside world khrustalevnosar was the embodiment of the saint petersburg soviet trotsky joined the soviet under the name yanovsky after the village he was born in yanovka and was elected vicechairman he did much of the actual work at the soviet and after khrustalevnosars arrest on 26 november 1905 was elected its chairman on 2 december the soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the tsarist government and its foreign debts \\nthe following day the soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested trotsky and other soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion on 4 october 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to siberia\\nsecond emigration 19071914\\nwhile en route to exile in obdorsk siberia in january 1907 trotsky escaped at berezov and once again made his way to london he attended the 5th congress of the rsdlp in october he moved to vienna austriahungary for the next seven years he often took part in the activities of the austrian social democratic party and occasionally of the german social democratic party\\nin vienna trotsky became close to adolph joffe his friend for the next 20 years who introduced him to psychoanalysis\\nin october 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of pravda truth a biweekly russianlanguage social democratic paper for russian workers which he coedited with adolph joffe and matvey skobelev it was smuggled into russia the paper appeared very irregularly only five issues were published in its first year\\navoiding factional politics the paper proved popular with russian industrial workers both the bolsheviks and the mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 19051907 revolution money was very scarce for the publication of pravda trotsky approached the russian central committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909\\na majority of bolsheviks controlled the central committee in 1910 lenin agreed to the financing of pravda but required a bolshevik to be appointed as coeditor of the paper when various bolshevik and menshevik factions tried to reunite at the january 1910 rsdlp central committee meeting in paris over lenins objections trotskys pravda was made a partyfinanced central organ lev kamenev trotskys brotherinlaw was added to the editorial board from the bolsheviks but the unification attempts failed in august 1910 kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations trotsky continued publishing pravda for another two years until it finally folded in april 1912\\nthe bolsheviks started a new workersoriented newspaper in saint petersburg on 22 april 1912 and also called it pravda trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspapers name that in april 1913 he wrote a letter to nikolay chkheidze a menshevik leader bitterly denouncing lenin and the bolsheviks though he quickly got over the disagreement the message was intercepted by the russian police and a copy was put into their archives shortly after lenins death in 1924 the letter was found and publicized by trotskys opponents within the communist party to portray him as lenins enemy\\nthe 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the rsdlp leading to numerous frictions between trotsky the bolsheviks and the mensheviks the most serious disagreement that trotsky and the mensheviks had with lenin at the time was over the issue of expropriations ie armed robbery of banks and other companies by bolshevik groups to procure money for the party these actions had been banned by the 5th congress but were continued by the bolsheviks\\nin january 1912 the majority of the bolshevik faction led by lenin as well as a few defecting mensheviks held a conference in prague and decided to break away from the russian social democratic labour party and formed a new party the russian social democratic labour party bolsheviks in response trotsky organized a unification conference of social democratic factions in vienna in august 1912 aka the august bloc and tried to reunite the bolsheviks and mensheviks into one party the attempt was generally unsuccessful\\nin vienna trotsky continuously published articles in radical russian and ukrainian newspapers such as kievskaya mysl under a variety of pseudonyms often using antid oto in september 1912 kievskaya mysl sent him to the balkans as its war correspondent where he covered the two balkan wars for the next year while there trotsky chronicled the ethnic cleansing carried out by the serbian army against the albanian civilian population he became a close friend of christian rakovsky later a leading soviet politician and trotskys ally in the soviet communist party on 3 august 1914 at the outbreak of world war i in which austriahungary fought against the russian empire trotsky was forced to flee vienna for neutral switzerland to avoid arrest as a russian migr\\nworld war i 19141917\\nthe outbreak of world war i caused a sudden realignment within the rsdlp and other european social democratic parties over the issues of war revolution pacifism and internationalism redividing the party into defeatists and defencists within the rsdlp lenin trotsky and martov advocated various internationalist antiwar positions that saw defeat for your own countrys ruling class imperialists as the lesser evil in the war while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war these antiwar believers were known as defeatists those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as defencists plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats both bolsheviks and mensheviks supported the russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war while trotskys excolleague parvus now a defencist sided against russia so strongly that he wanted germany to win the war in switzerland trotsky briefly worked within the swiss socialist party prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution he wrote a book opposing the war the war and the international and the prowar position taken by the european social democratic parties primarily the german party\\nas a war correspondent for the kievskaya mysl trotsky moved to france on 19 november 1914 in january 1915 in paris he began editing at first with martov who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left nashe slovo our word an internationalist socialist newspaper he adopted the slogan of peace without indemnities or annexations peace without conquerors or conquered lenin advocated russias defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the second international\\ntrotsky attended the zimmerwald conference of antiwar socialists in september 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who like martov would stay within the second international at any cost and those who like lenin would break with the second international and form a third international the conference adopted the middle line proposed by trotsky at first opposed in the end lenin voted for trotskys resolution to avoid a split among antiwar socialists\\nin september 1916 trotsky was deported from france to spain for his antiwar activities spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the united states on 25 december 1916 he arrived in new york city on 13 january 1917 he stayed for nearly three months at 1522 vyse avenue in the bronx in new york he wrote articles for the local russian language socialist newspaper novy mir and the yiddishlanguage daily der forverts the jewish daily forward in translation he also made speeches to russian migrs\\ntrotsky was living in new york city when the february revolution of 1917 overthrew tsar nicholas ii he left new york on 27 march 1917 but his ship the ss kristianiafjord was intercepted by british naval officials in canada at halifax nova scotia he was detained for a month at amherst internment camp in nova scotia while imprisoned in the camp trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates describing his month at the camp as one continual mass meeting\\ntrotskys speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of german officer inmates who complained to the british camp commander colonel morris about trotskys antipatriotic attitude morris then forbade trotsky to make any more public speeches leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against morris order back in russia after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers and peasants soviets the russian foreign minister pavel milyukov was compelled to demand the release of trotsky as a russian citizen and the british government freed him on 29 april 1917\\nhe reached russia on 17 may 1917 after his return trotsky substantially agreed with the bolshevik position but did not join them right away russian social democrats were split into at least six groups and the bolsheviks were waiting for the next party congress to determine which factions to merge with trotsky temporarily joined the mezhraiontsy a regional social democratic organization in saint petersburg and became one of its leaders at the first congress of soviets in june he was elected a member of the first allrussian central executive committee vtsik from the mezhraiontsy faction\\nafter an unsuccessful probolshevik uprising in saint petersburg trotsky was arrested on 7 august 1917 he was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counterrevolutionary uprising by lavr kornilov after the bolsheviks gained a majority in the petrograd soviet trotsky was elected chairman on  he sided with lenin against grigory zinoviev and lev kamenev when the bolshevik central committee discussed staging an armed uprising and he led the efforts to overthrow the provisional government headed by aleksandr kerensky\\nthe following summary of trotskys role in 1917 was written by stalin in pravda 6 november 1918 although this passage was quoted in stalins book the october revolution 1934 it was expunged from stalins works 1949\\nafter the success of the uprising on 78 november 1917 trotsky led the efforts to repel a counterattack by cossacks under general pyotr krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown provisional government at gatchina allied with lenin he defeated attempts by other bolshevik central committee members zinoviev kamenev rykov etc to share power with other socialist parties by the end of 1917 trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the bolshevik party after lenin he overshadowed the ambitious zinoviev who had been lenins top lieutenant over the previous decade but whose star appeared to be fading this reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both\\non 23 november 1917 trotsky revealed the secret treaty arrangements which had been made between the tsarist regime britain and france causing them considerable embarrassment\\nrussian revolution and aftermath\\ncommissar for foreign affairs and brestlitovsk 19171918\\nafter the bolsheviks came to power trotsky became the peoples commissar for foreign affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the triple entente that detailed plans for postwar reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders\\nin preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the german government and the representatives of the other central powers leading up to the treaty of brestlitovsk leon trotsky appointed his old friend adolph joffe to represent the bolsheviks when the soviet delegation learned that germans and austrohungarian planned to annex slices of polish territory and to set up a rump polish state with what remained while the baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by german princes the talks were recessed for 12 days the soviets only hopes were that given time their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western european proletariat would revolt so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations as foreign minister leon trotsky wrote to delay negotiations there must be someone to do the delaying therefore trotsky replaced joffe as the leader of the soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in brestlitovsk from 22 december 1917 to 10 february 1918 at that time the soviet government was split on the issue left communists led by nikolai bukharin continued to believe that there could be no peace between a soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a paneuropean soviet republic would bring a durable peace\\nthey cited the successes of the newly formed 15 january 1918 voluntary red army against polish forces of gen jzef dowbormunicki in belarus white forces in the don region and newly independent ukrainian forces as proof that the red army could repel german forces especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used\\nthey were willing to hold talks with the germans as a means of exposing german imperial ambitions territorial gains reparations etc in the hope of accelerating the hopedfor soviet revolution in the west still they were dead set against signing any peace treaty in the case of a german ultimatum they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against germany to inspire russian and european workers to fight for socialism this opinion was shared by left socialist revolutionaries who were then the bolsheviks junior partners in a coalition government\\nlenin who had earlier hoped for a speedy soviet revolution in germany and other parts of europe quickly decided that the imperial government of germany was still firmly in control and that without a strong russian military an armed conflict with germany would lead to a collapse of the soviet government in russia he agreed with the left communists that ultimately a paneuropean soviet revolution would solve all problems but until then the bolsheviks had to stay in power lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect but from january 1918 on advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a german ultimatum trotskys position was between these two bolshevik factions like lenin he admitted that the old russian military inherited from the monarchy and the provisional government and in advanced stages of decomposition was unable to fight\\nbut he agreed with the left communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the soviet government negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918 resurrect the notion that the bolsheviks secretly allied with the german government and cause an upsurge of internal resistance he argued that any german ultimatum should be refused and that this might well lead to an uprising in germany or at least inspire german soldiers to disobey their officers since any german offensive would be a naked grab for territories trotsky wrote in 1925\\ngermany resumed military operations on 18 february within a day it became clear that the german army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that red army detachments which were relatively small poorly organized and poorly led were no match for it on the evening of 18 february 1918 trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained and lenins proposal was accepted 74 the soviet government sent a radiogram to the german side taking the final brestlitovsk peace terms\\ngermany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive encountering little resistance the response arrived on 21 february but the proposed terms were so harsh that even lenin briefly thought that the soviet government had no choice but to fight but in the end the committee again voted 74 on 23 february 1918 the treaty of brestlitovsk was signed on 3 march and ratified on 15 march 1918 since trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the soviet delegation at brestlitovsk he resigned from his position as commissar for foreign affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy\\nhead of the red army spring 1918\\nthe entire bolshevik leadership of the red army including peoples commissar defence minister nikolai podvoisky and commanderinchief nikolai krylenko protested vigorously and eventually resigned they believed that the red army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries rely on propaganda and force and have elected officers they viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military much less put in charge of it their views continued to be popular with many bolsheviks throughout most of the russian civil war and their supporters including podvoisky who became one of trotskys deputies were a constant thorn in trotskys side the discontent with trotskys policies of strict discipline conscription and reliance on carefully supervised noncommunist military experts eventually led to the military opposition russian  which was active within the communist party in late 19181919\\non 13 march 1918 trotskys resignation as commissar for foreign affairs was officially accepted and he was appointed peoples commissar of army and navy affairsin place of podvoiskyand chairman of the supreme military council the post of commanderinchief was abolished and trotsky gained full control of the red army responsible only to the communist party leadership whose left socialist revolutionary allies had left the government over brestlitovsk\\ncivil war 19181920\\n1918\\nthe military situation soon tested trotskys managerial and organizationbuilding skills in mayjune 1918 the czechoslovak legions en route from european russia to vladivostok rose against the soviet government this left the bolsheviks with the loss of most of the countrys territory an increasingly wellorganized resistance by russian anticommunist forces usually referred to as the white army after their bestknown component and widespread defection by the military experts whom trotsky relied on\\ntrotsky and the government responded with a fullfledged mobilisation which increased the size of the red army from fewer than 300000 in may 1918 to one million in october and an introduction of political commissars into the army the latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts mostly former officers in the imperial army and cosigning their orders trotsky regarded the organisation of the red army as built on the ideas of the october revolution as he later wrote in his autobiography\\nin response to fanya kaplans failed assassination of lenin on 30 august 1918 and to the successful assassination of the petrograd cheka chief moisei uritsky on 17 august 1918 the bolsheviks instructed felix dzerzhinsky to commence a red terror announced in the 1 september 1918 issue of the krasnaya gazeta red gazette regarding the red terror trotsky wrote\\nin dealing with deserters trotsky often appealed to them politically arousing them with the ideas of the revolution\\ngiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies trotsky also insisted on the use of former tsarist officers as military specialists within the red army in combination with bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the red army lenin commented on this\\nin september 1918 the bolshevik government facing continuous military difficulties declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the red army the supreme military council was abolished and the position of commanderinchief was restored filled by the commander of the latvian riflemen loakim vatsetis aka jukums vcietis who had formerly led the eastern front against the czechoslovak legions vatsetis took charge of the daytoday operations of the army at the same time trotsky became chairman of the newly formed revolutionary military council of the republic and retained overall control of the military trotsky and vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918 while vatsetis and trotskys adviser mikhail bonchbruevich were also on unfriendly terms nevertheless trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly vatsetis\\nthe reorganization caused yet another conflict between trotsky and stalin in late september trotsky appointed former imperial general pavel pavlovich sytin to command the southern front but in early october 1918 stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled from the front lenin and yakov sverdlov tried to make trotsky and stalin reconcile but their meeting proved unsuccessful\\n1919\\nthroughout late 1918 and early 1919 there were a number of attacks on trotskys leadership of the red army including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by stalin and a direct attack by the military opposition at the viiith party congress in march 1919 on the surface he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first politburo after the congress but he later wrote\\nin mid1919 the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to trotskys leadership the red army grew from 800000 to 3000000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts\\nat the 34 july central committee meeting after a heated exchange the majority supported kamenev and smilga against vcietis and trotsky trotskys plan was rejected and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style much of it of a personal nature stalin used this opportunity to pressure lenin to dismiss trotsky from his post\\nhowever some significant changes to the leadership of the red army were made trotsky was temporarily sent to the southern front while smilga informally coordinated the work in moscow most members of the revolutionary military council who were not involved in its daytoday operations were relieved of their duties on 8 july and new members including smilga were added the same day while trotsky was in the south vcietis was suddenly arrested by the cheka on suspicion of involvement in an antisoviet plot and replaced by sergey kamenev after a few weeks in the south trotsky returned to moscow and resumed control of the red army a year later smilga and tukhachevsky were defeated during the battle of warsaw but trotsky refused this opportunity to pay smilga back which earned him smilgas friendship and later his support during the intraparty battles of the 1920s\\nby october 1919 the government was in the worst crisis of the civil war denikins troops approached tula and moscow from the south and general nikolay yudenichs troops approached petrograd from the west lenin decided that since it was more important to defend moscow petrograd would have to be abandoned trotsky argued that petrograd needed to be defended at least in part to prevent estonia and finland from intervening in a rare reversal trotsky was supported by stalin and zinoviev and prevailed against lenin in the central committee\\n1920\\nwith the defeat of denikin and yudenich in late 1919 the soviet governments emphasis shifted to the economy trotsky spent the winter of 191920 in the urals region trying to restart its economy a false rumor of his assassination circulated in germany and the international press on new years day 1920 based on his experiences he proposed abandoning the policies of war communism which included confiscating grain from peasants and partially restoring the grain market still committed to war communism lenin rejected his proposal\\nin early 1920 sovietpolish tensions eventually led to the polishsoviet war in the runup and during the war trotsky argued that the red army was exhausted and the soviet government should sign a peace treaty with poland as soon as possible he did not believe that the red army would find much support in poland proper lenin later wrote that he and other bolshevik leaders believed the red armys successes in the russian civil war and against the poles meant the defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over and we could and had the obligation to exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war\\npoland defeated the red army and the offensive was turned back during the battle of warsaw in august 1920 in part because of stalins failure to obey trotskys orders in the runup to the decisive engagements back in moscow trotsky again argued for a peace treaty and this time prevailed\\ntrade union debate 19201921\\ntrotskys position formed while he led a special commission on the soviet transportation system tsektran he was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the civil war being the commissar of war and a revolutionary military leader he saw a need to create a militarized production atmosphere by incorporating trade unions directly into the state apparatus his unyielding stance was that in a workers state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state and the state should fully control the unions in the ninth party congress he argued for a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour who cannot dispose of himself freely if the order is given to transfer him he must carry it out if he does not carry it out he will be a deserter who is punished who looks after this the trade unions it creates the new regime this is the militarisation of the working class\\nlenin sharply criticized trotsky and accused him of bureaucratically nagging the trade unions and of staging factional attacks his view did not focus on state control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the state and the rankandfile workers he said introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this this was a debate that lenin thought the party could not afford his frustration with trotsky was used by stalin and zinoviev with their support for lenins position to improve their standing within the bolshevik leadership at trotskys expense\\ndisagreements threatened to get out of hand and many bolsheviks including lenin feared that the party would splinter the central committee was split almost evenly between lenins and trotskys supporters with all three secretaries of the central committee krestinsky yevgeny preobrazhensky and leonid serebryakov supporting trotsky\\nat a meeting of his faction at the tenth party congress in march 1921 lenins faction won a decisive victory and a number of trotskys supporters including all three secretaries of the central committee lost their leadership positions krestinsky was replaced as a member of the politburo by zinoviev who had supported lenin krestinskys place in the secretariat was taken by vyacheslav molotov the congress also adopted a secret resolution on party unity which banned factions within the party except during precongress discussions the resolution was later published and used by stalin against trotsky and other opponents\\nat the end of the tenth congress after peace negotiations had failed trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the kronstadt rebellion the last major revolt against bolshevik rule trotskys role was questioned by other socialists including extrotskyists in the united states dwight macdonald broke with trotsky and left the trotskyist socialist workers party by noting the kronstadt rebellion a similar critique of trotskys role in the kronstadt rebellion was raised by american anarchist emma goldman in her essay trotsky protests too much she states i admit the dictatorship under stalins rule has become monstrous that does not however lessen the guilt of leon trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes some trotskyists most notably abbie bakan have argued that the claim that the kronstadt rebels were counterrevolutionary has been supported by evidence of white army and french government support for the kronstadt sailors march rebellion other historians most notably paul avrich claimed the evidence did not point towards this conclusion and saw the kronstadt rebellion as spontaneous\\ntrotskys contribution to the russian revolution\\nvladimir cherniaev a leading russian historian sums up trotskys main contributions to the russian revolution\\nhistorian geoffrey swain argues that\\nlenin said in 1921 that trotsky was in love with organisation but in working politics he has not got a clue swain explains the paradox by arguing that trotsky was not good at teamwork he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist not as a professional revolutionary like the others\\nlenins illness 19221923\\nin late 1921 lenins health deteriorated and he was absent from moscow for longer periods of time he had three strokes between 25 may 1922 and 9 march 1923 which caused paralysis loss of speech and finally death on 21 january 1924 with lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922 stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the central committee general secretary zinoviev and lev kamenev became part of the troika triumvirate formed by stalin to ensure that trotsky publicly the numbertwo man in the country and lenins heir presumptive would not succeed lenin\\nthe rest of the recently expanded politburo rykov mikhail tomsky bukharin was at first uncommitted but eventually joined the troika stalins power of patronage in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role but trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the civil war were over much of the bolshevik elite wanted normality while trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind\\nalthough the exact sequence of events is unclear evidence suggests that at first the troika nominated trotsky to head secondrate government departments eg gokhran the state depository for valuables in midjuly 1922 kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering lenin to the effect that the central committee is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard lenin was shocked and responded\\nfrom then until his final stroke lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the communist party leadership which was reflected in lenins testament as part of this effort on 11 september 1922 lenin proposed that trotsky become his deputy at the council of peoples commissars sovnarkom the politburo approved the proposal but trotsky categorically refused\\nin late 1922 trotsky secured an alliance with lenin against stalin and the emerging soviet bureaucracy stalin had recently engineered the creation of the union of soviet socialist republics ussr further centralising state control the alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade but was hindered by lenins progressing illness\\nin january 1923 lenin amended his testament to suggest that stalin should be removed as the partys general secretary while also mildly criticising trotsky and other bolshevik leaders the relationship between stalin and lenin had broken down completely by this time as was demonstrated during an event where stalin crudely insulted lenins wife nadezhda krupskaya in march 1923 days before his third stroke lenin asked trotsky to denounce stalin and his socalled greatrussian nationalistic campaign at the xiith party congress\\nat the xiith party congress in april 1923 however just after lenins final stroke trotsky did not raise the issue instead he made a speech about intraparty democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the troika stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him mostly at the expense of zinoviev and kamenevs backers\\nthe delegates most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the politburo gave trotsky a standing ovation this upset the troika already infuriated by karl radeks article leon trotsky  organiser of victory published in pravda on 14 march 1923 stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality while zinoviev delivered the central committee political report traditionally lenins prerogative among the resolutions adopted by the xiith congress were those calling for greater democracy within the party but these were vague and remained unimplemented\\nleft opposition 19231924\\nstarting in mid1923 the soviet economy ran into significant difficulties which led to numerous strikes countrywide two secret groups within the communist party workers truth and workers group were uncovered and suppressed by the soviet secret police on 8 october 1923 trotsky sent a letter to the central committee and the central control commission attributing these difficulties to lack of intraparty democracy trotsky wrote\\nother senior communists who had similar concerns sent the declaration of 46 to the central committee on 15 october in which they wrote\\nalthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time they had a significant effect on the party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the troika and its supporters on the issue of intraparty democracy notably in zinovievs pravda article published on 7 november throughout november the troika tried to come up with a compromise to placate or at least temporarily neutralise trotsky and his supporters their task was made easier by the fact that trotsky was sick in november and december the first draft of the resolution was rejected by trotsky which led to the formation of a special group consisting of stalin trotsky and kamenev which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise on 5 december the politburo and the central control commission unanimously adopted the groups final draft as its resolution on 8 december trotsky published an open letter in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolutions ideas the troika used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against trotsky accusing him of factionalism setting the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary bolsheviks and other sins\\ntrotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as the new course in january 1924 the illusion of a monolithic bolshevik leadership was thus shattered and a lively intraparty discussion ensued both in local party organizations and in the pages of pravda the discussion lasted most of december and january until the xiiith party conference of 1618 january 1924 those who opposed the central committees position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the left opposition in 1924 in a series of conferences at sverdlov university stalin cited several times in a critic waythe permanentists as the followers of trotsky permanent revolution\\nsince the troika controlled the party apparatus through stalins secretariat and pravda through its editor bukharin it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection although trotskys position prevailed within the red army and moscow universities and received about half the votes in the moscow party organisation it was defeated elsewhere and the conference was packed with protroika delegates in the end only three delegates voted for trotskys position and the conference denounced trotskyism as a petty bourgeois deviation\\nafter lenins death 1924\\nthere was little overt political disagreement within the soviet leadership throughout most of 1924 on the surface trotsky remained the most prominent and popular bolshevik leader although his mistakes were often alluded to by troika partisans behind the scenes he was completely cut off from the decisionmaking process politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the troika and its supporters trotskys control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy ephraim sklyansky and appointing mikhail frunze who was being groomed to take trotskys place\\nat the thirteenth party congress in may trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech\\nin the meantime the left opposition which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intraparty regime began to crystallise it lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the troika but it also began formulating a program\\nconomically the left opposition and its theoretician yevgeni preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation that put them at odds with bukharin and rykov the right group within the party who supported the troika at the time on the question of world revolution trotsky and karl radek saw a period of stability in europe while stalin and zinoviev confidently predicted an acceleration of revolution in western europe in 1924 on the theoretical plane trotsky remained committed to the bolshevik idea that the soviet union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution while stalin gradually came up with a policy of building socialism in one country these ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between trotsky and the left opposition on the one hand and stalin and his allies on the other\\nat the thirteenth congress kamenev and zinoviev helped stalin defuse lenins testament which belatedly came to the surface but just after the congress the troika always an alliance of convenience showed signs of weakness stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about zinoviev and kamenev yet in october 1924 trotsky published lessons of october an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution\\nin it he described zinovievs and kamenevs opposition to the bolshevik seizure of power in 1917 something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned this started a new round of intraparty struggle which became known as the literary discussion with zinoviev and kamenev again allied with stalin against trotsky their criticism of trotsky was concentrated in three areas\\ntrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him they succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as peoples commissar of army and fleet affairs and chairman of the revolutionary military council on 6 january 1925 zinoviev demanded trotskys expulsion from the communist party but stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate trotsky kept his politburo seat but was effectively put on probation\\na year in the wilderness 1925\\nfor trotsky 1925 was a difficult year after the bruising literary discussion and losing his red army posts he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring in may 1925 he was given three posts chairman of the concessions committee head of the electrotechnical board and chairman of the scientifictechnical board of industry trotsky wrote in my life that he was taking a rest from politics and naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\\nsome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man later in the year trotsky resigned his two technical positions maintaining stalininstigated interference and sabotage and concentrated on his work in the concessions committee\\nin one of the few political developments that affected trotsky in 1925 the circumstances of the controversy over lenins testament were described by american marxist max eastman in his book since lenin died 1925 trotsky denied these statements made by eastman in an article he wrote\\nin the meantime the troika finally broke up bukharin and rykov sided with stalin while krupskaya and soviet commissar of finance grigory sokolnikov aligned with zinoviev and kamenev the struggle became open at the september 1925 meeting of the central committee and came to a head at the xiv party congress in december 1925 with only the leningrad party organization behind them zinoviev and kamenev dubbed the new opposition were thoroughly defeated while trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the congress\\nunited opposition 19261927\\nin early 1926 zinoviev kamenev and their supporters in the new opposition gravitated closer to trotskys supporters and the two groups soon formed an alliance which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the communist party the alliance became known as the united opposition\\nthe united opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the stalinist leadership of the communist party and trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats mostly to preserve his alliance with zinoviev and kamenev the opposition remained united against stalin throughout 1926 and 1927 especially on the issue of the chinese revolution the methods used by the stalinists against the opposition became more and more extreme at the xv party conference in october 1926 trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls and at the end of the conference he lost his politburo seat in 1927 stalin started using the gpu soviet secret police to infiltrate and discredit the opposition rankandfile oppositionists were increasingly harassed sometimes expelled from the party and even arrested\\nsoviet policy toward the chinese revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between stalin and the united opposition the chinese revolution began on 10 october 1911 resulting in the abdication of the chinese emperor puyi on 12 february 1912 sun yatsen established the republic of china\\nin reality however the republic controlled very little of the country much of china was divided between various regional warlords the republican government established a new nationalist peoples army and a national peoples partythe kuomintang in 1920 the kuomintang opened relations with soviet russia with soviet help the republic of china built up the nationalist peoples army with the development of the nationalist army a northern expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country this northern expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by stalin and trotsky stalin tried to persuade the small chinese communist party to merge with the kuomintang kmt nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a sovietstyle working class revolution\\ntrotsky wanted the communist party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the kmt stalin funded the kmt during the expedition stalin countered trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that chiangs rightwing kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists that chiang kaishek had funding from the rich merchants and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded however chiang quickly reversed the tables in the shanghai massacre of 12 april 1927 by massacring the communist party in shanghai midway through the northern expedition\\ndefeat and exile 19271928\\nduring this time trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend the soviet diplomat adolph joffe in november 1927 it would be the last speech that trotsky would give in the soviet union when the xv party congress made united opposition views incompatible with membership in the communist party zinoviev kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the left opposition trotsky and most of his followers on the other hand refused to surrender and stayed the course trotsky was exiled to alma ata kazakhstan on 31 january 1928 he was expelled from the soviet union to turkey in february 1929 accompanied by his wife natalia sedova and their eldest son lev\\nfate of left oppositionists after trotskys exile 19291941\\nafter trotskys expulsion from the soviet union trotskyists within the soviet union began to waver between 1929 and 1932 most leading members of the left opposition surrendered to stalin admitted their mistakes and were reinstated in the communist party one initial exception to this was christian rakovsky who inspired trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to stalin increased by the year in late 1932 rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the soviet union and was exiled to yakutia in march 1933 answering trotskys request the french mathematician and trotskyist jean van heijenoort together with his fellow activist pierre frank unsuccessfully called on the influential soviet author maxim gorky to intervene in favor of christian rakovsky and boarded the ship he was traveling on near constantinople according to heijenoort they only managed to meet gorkys son maxim peshkov who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed but promised to pass on their request rakovsky was the last prominent trotskyist to capitulate to stalin in april 1934 when rakovsky formally admitted his mistakes his letter to pravda titled there should be no mercy depicted trotsky and his supporters as agents of the german gestapo rakovsky was appointed to high office in the commissariat for health and allowed to return to moscow also serving as soviet ambassador to japan in 1935 however rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of sergey kirov and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937 during the great purge\\nalmost all trotskyists who were still within the soviet unions borders were executed in the great purges of 19361938 although rakovsky survived until the medvedev forest massacre of september 1941 where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on stalins orders less than three months into the axis invasion of the soviet union also among the medvedev forest victims was trotskys sisterkamenevs first wife olga kameneva\\nexile 19291940\\nin february 1929 trotsky was deported from the soviet union to his new exile in turkey during his first two months in turkey trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the soviet union consulate in istanbul and then at a nearby hotel in the city in april 1929 trotsky his wife and son were moved to the island of bykada by the turkish authorities on bykada they were moved into a house called the yanaros mansion during his exile in turkey trotsky was under the surveillance of the turkish police forces of mustafa kemal pasha trotsky was also at risk from the many former white army officers who lived on prinkipo officers who had opposed the october revolution and who had been defeated by trotsky and the red army in the russian civil war however trotskys european supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety at this time he made requests to enter belgium france norway germany and the united kingdom but all refused access\\nin 1931 trotsky wrote a letter to a friend entitled what is fascism in which he attempted to define fascism and asserted that the comintern was wrong to describe the dictatorship of primo de rivera as fascist because it wasnt a mass movement arising from a base in the lower classes\\non 20 february 1932 trotsky and all of his family lost their soviet citizenship and were forbidden to enter the soviet union in 1932 trotsky entered via a port into the fascist kingdom of italy on his way to a socialist conference in denmark by the end of 1932 trotsky had joined a conspiratorial political bloc with the antistalin opposition inside the ussr there was no evidence of any alliance with nazi germany or japan as the soviet union government claimed the alleged members of the antistalin bloc were zinovievites rightists and trotskyists who capitulated to stalin kamenev and zinoviev were also alleged members of the bloc trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc historian pierre brou concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933 since some of its members like zinoviev and kamenev joined stalin again and because there were no letters in the trotsky harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932 in july 1933 trotsky was offered asylum in france by prime minister douard daladier trotsky accepted the offer but he was forbidden to live in paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the french police from july 1933 to february 1934 trotsky and his wife lived in royan the philosopher and activist simone weil also arranged for trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents house following the 6 february 1934 crisis in france the french minister of internal affairs albert sarraut signed a decree to deport trotsky from france however no foreign government was found willing to accept trotsky within its borders accordingly the french authorities instructed trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of barbizon under the strict surveillance of the french police where trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in turkey\\nin may 1935 soon after the french government had agreed to the francosoviet treaty of mutual assistance with the soviet union government trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in france after weighing his options trotsky applied to move to norway after obtaining permission from justice minister trygve lie to enter the country trotsky and his wife became a guest of konrad knudsen at norderhov near hnefoss and spent over a year living at knudsens house from 18 june 1935 to 2 september 1936 although trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby oslo community hospital from 19 september 1935\\xa0\\nfollowing french media complaints about trotskys role in encouraging the mass strikes in france in may and june 1936 with his articles the johan nygaardsvoldled norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about trotskys actions in the summer of 1936 trotskys asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist nasjonal samling led by vidkun quisling\\xa0 along with an increase in pressure from the soviet government on the norwegian authorities on 5 august 1936 knudsens house was burgled by fascists from the nasjonal samling while trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with knudsen and his wife the burglars targeted trotskys works and archives for vandalism the raid was largely thwarted by knudsens daughter hjrdis although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left although the perpetrators were caught and put on trial the evidence obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against trotsky\\xa0\\non 14 august 1936 the soviet press agency tass announced the discovery of a trotskyistzinovievist plot and the imminent start of the trial of the sixteen accused trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into moscows accusations the accused were sentenced to death including grigory zinoviev and lev kamenev and executed on 25 august 1936 on 26 august 1936 eight policemen arrived at knudsens house demanding that trotsky sign new conditions for residing in norway these conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters to give no interviews and to have all his correspondence incoming and outgoing inspected by the police trotsky categorically refused the conditions and trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence the following day trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities with the police officially citing trotsky as a witness to the fascist raid of 5 august 1936\\non 2 september 1936 four weeks after the breakin at knudsens house trygve lie ordered that trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in hurum where they were under house arrest\\xa0 the treatment of trotsky and his wife at hurum was harsh as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm\\xa0 trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in norway and beyond only trotskys lawyers and the norwegian labour party parliamentary leader olav scheflo were permitted to visit\\xa0 from october 1936 even the outdoor walks were prohibited for trotsky and his wife\\xa0 trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 december 1936 titled the moscow confessions on 19 december 1936 trotsky and his wife were deported from norway after being put on the norwegian oil tanker ruth under guard by jonas lie when later living in mexico trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at hurum and accused the norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the trial of the sixteen and other show trials saying\\nthe ruth arrived in mexico on 9 january 1937\\xa0 on trotskys arrival the mexican president lzaro crdenas welcomed trotsky to mexico and arranged for his special train the hidalgo to bring trotsky to mexico city from the port of tampico\\nfrom january 1937 to april 1939 trotsky and his wife lived in the coyoacn area of mexico city at la casa azul the blue house the home of the painter diego rivera and riveras wife and fellow painter frida kahlo with whom trotsky had an affair his final move was a few blocks away to a residence on avenida viena in april 1939 following a break with rivera\\ntrotsky wrote prolifically while in exile penning several key works including his history of the russian revolution 1930 and the revolution betrayed 1936 a critique of the soviet union under stalinism he argued that the soviet state had become a degenerated workers state controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy which would eventually either be overthrown via a political revolution establishing a workers democracy or degenerate into a capitalist class\\nwhile in mexico trotsky also worked closely with james p cannon joseph hansen and farrell dobbs of the socialist workers party of the united states and other supporters cannon a longtime leading member of the american communist movement had supported trotsky in the struggle against stalinism since he had first read trotskys criticisms of the soviet union in 1928 trotskys critique of the stalinist regime though banned was distributed to leaders of the comintern among his other supporters was chen duxiu founder of the chinese communist party\\nwhile in mexico trotsky worked with andr breton and diego rivera to write the manifesto for an independent revolutionary art which inspired the creation of the organization the international federation of independent revolutionary art fiari in 1938 this organization was shortlived and ended before 1940\\nmoscow show trials\\nin august 1936 the first moscow show trial of the socalled trotskyitezinovievite terrorist center was staged in front of an international audience during the trial zinoviev kamenev and 14 other accused most of them prominent old bolsheviks confessed to having plotted with trotsky to kill stalin and other members of the soviet leadership the court found everybody guilty and sentenced the defendants to death trotsky in absentia the second show trial of karl radek grigori sokolnikov yuri pyatakov and 14 others took place in january 1937 during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to trotsky the findings were published in the book not guilty\\nfourth international\\nfor fear of splitting the communist movement trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel communist parties or a parallel international communist organization that would compete with the third international in mid1933 after the nazi takeover in germany and the cominterns response to it he changed his mind he said\\nin 1938 trotsky and his supporters founded the fourth international which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the stalinist comintern\\ndies committee\\ntowards the end of 1939 trotsky agreed to go to the united states to appear as a witness before the dies committee of the house of representatives a forerunner of the house committee on unamerican activities representative martin dies jr chairman of the committee demanded the suppression of the american communist party trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the nkvds activities against him and his followers\\nhe made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the american communist party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform world war ii into a world revolution many of his supporters argued against his appearance when the committee learned the nature of the testimony trotsky intended to present it refused to hear him and he was denied a visa to enter the united states on hearing about it the communist party of the soviet union immediately accused trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the federal bureau of investigation\\nfinal months\\nafter quarreling with diego rivera trotsky moved to his final residence on avenida viena in april 1939 on 27 february 1940 trotsky wrote a document known as trotskys testament in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity he was suffering from high blood pressure and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage after forcefully denying stalins accusations that he had betrayed the working class he thanked his friends and above all his wife natalia sedova for their loyal support\\nassassination\\nafter a failed attempt to have trotsky murdered in march 1939 stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the nkvd officer pavel sudoplatov who in turn coopted nahum eitingon according to sudoplatovs special tasks the nkvd proceeded to set up three nkvd agent networks to carry out the murder these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the nkvds hithertoestablished spy networks in the us and mexico\\non 24 may 1940 trotsky survived a raid on his villa by armed assassins led by the nkvd agent iosif grigulevich and mexican painter david alfaro siqueiros trotskys 14yearold grandson vsevolod platonovich esteban volkov born 7 march 1926 was shot in the foot a young assistant and bodyguard of trotsky robert sheldon harte disappeared with the attackers and was later found murdered it is probable that he was an accomplice who granted them access to the villa trotskys other guards fended off the attackers following the failed assassination attempt trotsky wrote an article titled stalin seeks my death on 8 june 1940 in which he stated that another assassination attempt was certain\\non 20 august 1940 trotsky was attacked in his study by spanishborn nkvd agent ramn mercader who used an ice axe as a weapon\\na mountaineering ice axe has a narrow end called the pick and a flat wide end called the adze the adze of the axe wounded trotsky fracturing his parietal bone and penetrating into his brain the blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill trotsky instantly witnesses stated that trotsky spat on mercader and began struggling fiercely with him which resulted in mercaders hand being broken hearing the commotion trotskys bodyguards burst into the room and nearly beat mercader to death but trotsky stopped them laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions trotsky was then taken to a hospital and operated on surviving for more than a day but dying at the age of 60 on 21 august 1940 from exsanguination and shock mercader later testified at his trial\\naccording to james p cannon the trotskyist secretary of the american socialist workers party trotskys last words were i will not survive this attack stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before mercader was tried and convicted of the murder and spent the next 20 years in a mexican prison stalin wrote that the assassin of trotsky was a dangerous trotskyist this is why mercader had no awards initially though his mother was presented with the order of lenin for her own part of the operation ramn mercader could not be either assassinated or freed from prison by the soviets but when he had been released from jail in 1960 and arrived to the ussr in 1961 leonid brezhnev signed a sentence to award ramon ivanovich lopez with the order of lenin the gold star of the hero and the title of the hero of the soviet union for the special deed the kgb boss alexander shelepin presented all these awards to ramn mercader in person\\nlegacy\\ntrotskys house in coyoacn has been preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day he was assassinated there and is now the leon trotsky museum in mexico city run by a board which includes his grandson esteban volkov trotskys grave is located on its grounds the foundation international friends of the leon trotsky museum has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further\\ntrotsky was never formally rehabilitated during the rule of the soviet government despite the destalinizationera rehabilitation of most other old bolsheviks killed during the great purges his son sergei sedov who died in 1937 was rehabilitated in 1988 as was nikolai bukharin beginning in 1989 trotskys books forbidden until 1987 were published in the soviet union\\ntrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 june 2001 by the general prosecutors office certificates of rehabilitation no 13218290 no 13220099 in archives research center memorial\\ncontributions to marxist theory\\ntrotsky considered himself to be a bolshevikleninist arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party he viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox marxism\\nhis politics differed from some aspects from those of stalin or mao zedong most importantly in his rejection of the theory of socialism in one country and his declaring of the need for an international permanent revolution numerous fourth internationalist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition however they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this supporters of the fourth international echo trotskys opposition to stalinist totalitarianism advocating political revolution and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy\\npermanent revolution\\nthe permanent revolution concept is the theory that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers state and that the creation of a workers state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property thus the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks although most closely associated with leon trotsky the call for a permanent revolution is first found in the writings of karl marx and friedrich engels in march 1850 in the aftermath of the 1848 revolution in their address of the central committee to the communist league\\ntrotskys conception of the permanent revolution is based on his understanding drawing on the work of the founder of russian marxism georgy plekhanov that in backward countries the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with alexander parvus in late 19041905 the relevant articles were later collected in trotskys books 1905 and in permanent revolution which also contains his essay results and prospects some trotskyists have argued that the state of the third world shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries thus again proving the central tenet of the theory\\nunited front\\ntrotsky was a central figure in the comintern during its first four congresses during this time he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the bolsheviks to newly formed communist parties across europe and further afield from 1921 onwards the united front a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution was the central tactic put forward by the comintern after the defeat of the german revolution\\nafter he was exiled and politically marginalized by stalinism trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in germany and spain according to joseph choonara of the british socialist workers party in international socialism his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy'}, {'title': 'George_Galloway', 'label': 'Politician',

britain to receive treatment for leukaemia the intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of other iraqi children due to poor health conditions and lack of

the 2003 invasion of iraq the fund received scrutiny after a complaint that galloway used some donated money to pay for his travel expenses he responded by stating that the expenses were incurred in his capacity as the appeals chairman although the mariam appeal was never a registered charity and never intended to be such it was investigated by the charity commission the report of this yearlong inquiry published in june 2004 found that the mariam appeal was undertaking charitable work and so ought to have registered with the commission but did not substantiate allegations that any funds had been misused it emerged some years later that galloway had appealed in a letter dated 24 april 2003 to lord goldsmith the attorneygeneral to stop the investigation into the mariam appeal according to a report in the times after the letter was released under the freedom of information act galloway falsely asserted that the appeal received no money from iraq\\na further charity commission report

himself as a supporter of the iraqi people and the baath party but not saddam hussein himself\\nin august 2002 galloway returned to iraq and met saddam hussein for a second and final time according to

in his memoir im not the only one first published in 2004 galloway wrote that just as stalin industrialised the soviet union so on a different scale saddam plotted iraqs own great leap forward he continued he managed to keep his country together until 1991 indeed he is likely to have been the leader in history who came closest to creating a truly iraqi national identity and he developed iraq

bush had lied to the british air force and navy when they said the battle of iraq would be very quick and easy they attacked iraq like wolves and added that the best thing british troops can do is to

interview with tony blair who said his comments were disgraceful and wrong the national executive will deal with it at this time labour mp tam dalyell commented in galloways defence i think he is a

office in the party pending a hearing on charges that he had violated the partys constitution by bringing the labour party into disrepute through behaviour that is prejudicial or grossly detrimental

on 22 october 2003 to consider the charges taking evidence from galloway himself from other party witnesses viewing media interviews and hearing character testimony from former cabinet minister tony benn among others the following day the committee decided in favour of four of the five charges accusing galloway of bringing the party into disrepute and expelled galloway from the labour party a

was the only labour mp who incited foreign forces to rise up against british troops in the iraq war galloway said after the ncc had decided on his expulsion this was a politically motivated kangaroo court whose verdict had been written in advance in the best tradition of political show trials galloway claimed at the time that other mps who had opposed the war such as bob marshall andrews and glenda jackson would be expelled in due course but no other mp was expelled from the labour party for their statements about the iraq war after an article by galloway was published in the morning star attacking the labour party tony benn wrote in his diary in june 2004 quoting from the article that if he had persuaded the nec not to expel him galloway would have remained a member of a party

the nature of the discovery within an unguarded bombedout building as being questionable he instigated legal action against the newspaper which was heard in the high court on 14 november 2004\\non 2 december justice david eady ruled that the story had been seriously defamatory and that the daily telegraph was obliged to compensate mr galloway  and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation galloway was awarded damages of 150000 plus after a failed appeal in 2006 legal costs of about 2\\xa0million\\nboth sides regarded the libel case as an important test of the reynolds qualifiedprivilege defence the daily telegraph did not attempt to claim justification where the defendant seeks to prove the truth of the defamatory reports it has never been the telegraphs case to suggest that the allegations contained in these documents are true the newspaper argued that it acted responsibly as the allegations it reported were of sufficient public interest to outweigh the damage caused to galloways reputation the trial judge did not accept this defence noting that comments such as galloway being guilty of treason in saddams pay and being saddams little helper caused him the judge to conclude that the newspaper was not neutral but both embraced the allegations with relish and fervour and went on to embellish them additionally the judge ruled galloway had not been given a fair or reasonable opportunity to make inquiries or meaningful comment upon the documents before they were published\\noliver thorne a forensic expert later stated in my opinion the evidence found fully supports that the vast majority of the submitted documents are authentic\\nother libel claims\\nthe christian science monitor also published a story on 25 april 2003 stating that it had

and fawaz zureikat aziz had told the investigators these oil allocations were for the benefit of george galloway and for mariams appeal the proceeds from the sale benefited the cause and mr galloway\\ngalloway reiterated his denial of the charges and asked the us senate committee to charge him with perjury so that he could confront the charges in court he said the investigation was an attempt to divert attention from the pack of lies that led to the iraq invasion in 2003 he claimed colemans motive was revenge over the embarrassment of his appearance before the committee in may\\ngalloway also said the claim aziz had told investigators he had benefited financially via zureikat from the oil for food programme had been rejected by aziz via his french lawyers a contemporary

former iraqi administration or from the oilforfood programme but admitted that some documents had been unavailable to him however the committee concluded in the main body of the report\\nit found that galloways use of parliamentary resources to support his work on the mariam appeal went beyond what was reasonable and we recommend that he apologise to the house and be suspended from its service for a period of 18 actual sitting days\\ngalloways suspension was not intended to be immediate and he was given the opportunity to defend himself in front of the committee members in the house of commons on 23 july 2007 during the debate galloway repeatedly called into question the motives of the members of the select committee in particular claiming that some of them were members of a political organisation named indict and were persecuting him for speaking out against the iraq war speaker michael martin warned galloway that his accusations were not relevant to the matter at hand but he

are not jews these people have used jewish people  they created the conditions in the arab countries and in some european countries to stampede jewish people out of the countries that they had been living in for many hundreds of years and stampede them into the zionist state\\nduring an interview for al jazeera television on 17 november 2005 he said his election as mp earlier in the year was despite all the efforts made by the british government the zionist movement and the newspapers and news media which are controlled by zionism in trials of the diaspora a history of antisemitism in england anthony julius cites this interview as one example of galloway pandering to the antisemitic prejudices of his audience according to julius galloway merely refers to the rightwing press in the british media whereas he has the habit of adding the word zionist when speaking on television in the arab world a few years later in a may 2009 speech given at a meeting in westminster galloway said i do not agree with the argument that there is a shadowy jewish influence israel is doing what america wants it to do and to argue otherwise is to go down the dark tunnel of racist antisemitism\\nat a

murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the jews in warsaw in 1943 jonathan freedland in the guardian thought the effect of repeating again and again that israel is a nazi state was potentially an incitement to attack jews because the comparison with nazis as the embodiment of evil implies that the only appropriate response is hate sigrid rausing in the new statesman wrote the claim of moral equivalence is dangerous not because it exaggerates the horror of gaza the reality of that bombardment was probably worse than we can really imagine but because it minimises the horror of the holocaust\\nviva palestina aid convoys\\nin response to the 200809 israelgaza conflict galloway instigated the viva palestina aid convoy to the gaza strip in january 2009 there is a kind of

state his intention of suing the jewishromanian community league or federation of jewish communities of romania fcer this was because during the scandal grbea had explained that the fcers reaction was

frankfurt book fair october 2010 in april 2011 grbea and fellow writer ruxandra cesereanu were in israel attending the nisan poetry festival in maghar\\nwork\\ncultural context and postmodernist reinterpretations\\ncommitted to postmodernism grbea debuted as a member of the optzeciti group of writers most of whom reached their creative peak after 1980 together with mircea crtrescu traian t coovei florin iaru doru mare radu g eposu and ion stratan he was part of the optzeciti nucleus inside cenaclul de luni given his relatively late consecration grbea is nevertheless identified with the 1990s generation of postoptzeciti this also reflects grbeas own positioning according to his own statement the move from one generation group to the other coincided with his leaving cenaclul de luni and joining universitas in 2008 he expressed much criticism for orbitor a largescale novelistic cycle by the optzeciti group leader crtrescu in her critical overview of grbeas contributions observator cultural chronicler bianca buracernat describes him as one among the lesser authors of the 1990s generation alongside dansilviu boerescu and mihail glanu writing for the 2007 columbia university encyclopedia of modern drama romanianborn israeli actordirector moshe yassur included grbea among the best known of post1989 playwrights experimenting with postabsurdsurrealist modes of expression others in this group are according to his definition radu macrinici alina mungiupippidi alina nelega saviana stnescu matei viniec and vlad zografi in a 2001 overview of the generations contribution nelega herself mentioned grbea and the others alongside valentin nicolau and rzvan petrescu\\na defining characteristic of grbeas main works is the reliance on intertextuality as compliments to his predecessors in drama novel and poetry speaking in 2009 grbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s it still seemed to me that being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too  i could not write prose but i enjoyed writing drama because i had invented something very fun to do old characters in new situations poet and critic octavian soviany noted horia grbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play the parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their rewriting  is still possible commenting on the texts grouped within cine la ucis pe marx literary critic mircea a diaconu placed the intertextual references which often make a point of transgressing historical reality in connection with william shakespeares phrase all the worlds a stage since everything is possible at the level of the text becoming reality he praises the author for managing to preserve an absence that imposes by not making his own intervention felt in the text diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as gratuitously bookish where a line is more important than an event a pun more important than a murder but supports the notion that they all display an existential bearing accounting for an intrinsic value he speaks of the technique as a vengeance of the theater on the traditional historical record in essence horia grbeas theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history or better yet from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world\\ngeneric traits and related polemics\\nbeyond its immediate context critics see horia grbeas contribution as greatly indebted to the work of 19th century dramatist and humorist ion luca caragiale according to diaconu caragiales influence constitutes the depth of grbeas work going beyond the surface level of intertextual references and tributes at the same core level diaconu identifies the authors debt to eugne ionesco while also judging his manner of mixing eras languages writings characters or historical figures fiction and document to echo the techniques of argentinian writer jorge luis borges another main influence on grbeas work is interwar author mateiu caragiale made famous by his cultivated style and eccentric outlook critic dumitru ungureanu sees this cultural echo as having been filtered by the style of radu albala one of the authors to have been most inspired by the matein narratives and concludes that the lineage places grbea on the same level as crtrescu and florin lapac\\naccording to his generation colleague essayist dansilviu boerescu grbea cannot part with the speculative charm of a brain given to bookish games but closely follows a realistic tradition with his sarcastic analysis of  all everyday weakness for boerescu grbeas literature is supported by his sarcasm and his contribution to romanian humor thin and edgy like a razor grbeas style forgives no one no thing soviany also argues that the rewriting of texts attempted by the romanian author is carried by absurd humor and the most unusual as well as the most hilarious arrangements of famous characters and quotes poet and critic paul aretzu writes the staple of horia grbeas writing is inventive farcical the obvious attribute of intelligence and refinement also displaying bookish support and being enhanced by zestful language  the tendency of visualizing of sketching portraits of detailingdissecting scenes of verifying orality the expressive value of the language reveal the authors dominant structure as a playwright the alternation of such stylistic traits reflects in part the writers own parting with the optzeciti the focus on everyday issues prompted ctlin rlea to view grbeas 1990s prose as a revival of neorealism after the optzeciti experimentalism boerescu however believes this verdict to be only half right since the writer continued to employ experimental devices long after 1989 while avoiding the referential ostentation of other writers appreciation of grbeas work was also expressed among older critics and grbeas own mentors nicolae manolescu held grbeas contribution in high esteem an in his 2008 synthesis of romanian literary history spoke of him as having indisputably the fabric of a dramatist\\nin nelegas view grbea one of the truly alive writers of his time was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by prominent romanian directorsalexandru darie alexandru hausvater and gavril pinte grbeas fellow romnia literar contributor literary historian alex tefnescu contrasted his writings with the boring works by some of his contemporaries and claimed that directors and actors take pleasure in staging grbeas plays grbeas work stands out within its cultural and temporal context for its size and diversity aretzu sees him as one of the most ubiquitous authors in presentday literature  gifted with a great availability in processing reality while critic and academic nicolae oprea believes him to be the most prolific among the bucharestbased group formed in the 1990s literary reviewer daniel cristeaenache also describes his colleague as multilateral who can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genres specificity writing in 2007 tefnescu defined him a oneman orchestra  of the apathetic and sometimes shybrazen romanian literature of today according to moldovan writer emilian galaicupun as productive as an entire literary school  horia grbea is a veritable stakhanovite of writing who has dealt in all genres and species grbea is also among the post1990 romanian authors to have received recognition abroad in addition to the performances of the serpent and il mmagement grbeas ra cu portocale has been translated into german by veronika dreichlinger ente mit apfelsine published in 2005 his work was also included into english french german russian and serbianlanguage anthologies\\nthere are several controversial aspects to grbeas public notoriety involving reactions against academic verdicts and objecting to the close relationship between grbea and mainstream cultural forums such as the usr the implications of positive appraisals by these venues were debated by literary critic bogdan creu who argued that nicolae manolescu tended to overrate authors in his proximity while being dismissive of viniecs contribution to drama which manolescu had claimed lacked originality critic dan c mihilescu criticized in particular manolescus caprices suggesting that in a 2008 synthesis of romanian literary history his older colleague had assigned grbeas entry undeserved space more than to a better known novelist like gib mihescu also according to mihilescu crtrescu may have had his rival grbea in mind when reproaching manolescu that he had insisted on writers who were not at all worthy of recognition nicolae oprea saw grbea as apparently uninhibited in matters of literary discourse but critically noted that the poet was also preoccupied to the point of obsession with his own cultural imprint citing as proof the fact that in its original version creterea iguanelor de cas features the englishlanguage versions of five poems translated by grbeas own hand a highly critical voice is that of bianca buracernat she suggests that in adopting all forms of writing grbea displays an implausible selfcertainty she polemically connects the critical appreciation with his status as a good colleague and devoted shadow of other writers noting that grbeas notoriety is ensured by a promotional system with all the stakes and all the pulleys as well as by the argument of prolificity but that these attributes also surpass his actual value\\nplays\\nusually assigned by their author the name of texts in preference over plays several among grbeas earliest works for the stage are postmodern reworkings of classical motifs fashioned into new statements about the limits of literature his pescruul din livada cu viini is a personal take on anton chekhovs cherry orchard and seagull according to the authors own assessment the text fits in with a chekhovian homage trend among romanian dramatists also including iosif naghius chekhov the armorer and viniecs la machine tchekhov the chekhov machine soviany singles out the text as an answer to claims that parody is always inferior to its models by identifying its original motifs in a new statement about theater itself the play which is without doubt ascribable to the formula of apocalyptic theater draws its substance from mixing intertextual parody with an eschatologic vision suggesting the regression of world and literature into the primordial mud putting to use  the deluge myth the dramatist this time imagines an apocalypse of fiction of the theater during which the characters  are slowly being swallowed by the mud flows of subterranean waters which could imply that literature fiction unavoidably secretes its own death so that writing being written and dying end up being perfect synonyms in this analogy between literature and death soviany argues one finds the most profound message of horia grbeas theater in doamna bovary snt ceilali the theme and protagonists are borrowed from gustave flauberts 1857 novel reused by the author to make a statement about drama itself and combined with elements from jeanpaul sartres no exit in addition to such themes mircea a diaconu sees grbeas reflection on the conflict between history and fiction as personified by the lead character in stpnul tcerii the egyptian god thoth who bestows the gift of language on man is depicted as the prototype of traitors\\npublished ten years after the romanian revolution decembrie n direct recounts a changing of roles between torturer and victim set to the background of political turmoil in the first part it introduces the two protagonists a failed boxer turned interrogator for the main communist repressive structure the securitate who confronts his prisoner a renegade nomenklatura member who has become a dissident what is supposed to be an ordeal for the latter turns into a revelation for the former the dissident is successful in assuring his interrogator that communism is doomed and both flee the prison to partake in the victorious revolution the second part sees the dissident transformed into an agent for the reformed intelligence service who displays no qualms about capturing tormenting and finally killing his former associate historiographer and critic ruxandra cesereanu connects the outcome with a notoriously violent episode in romanias communist history the brainwashing experiment carried out by the securitate in piteti prison the paradox and moralantimoral of horia grbeas play is that the victim  proves himself tougher more of an executioner than his torturer this means that the lines between victim and executioner are blurred and that ultimately the reeducation experiment in piteti prison 19491952 when victims were forced into becoming torturers has succeeded the antimoral in grbeas play is however all the more tough as the victim here becomes a torturer without being made to do so cesereanu ranks it and radu macrinicis tara mea approx my dead weightcountry among the post1989 dramatic texts to have brought up  the securitate issue in a trenchant and even revelatory manner grbeas fellow playwright alina nelega notes that decembrie n direct is his first entirely original text for the stage and rates it over intertextual texts from the same period\\npublished alongside decembrie n direct capul lui mooc moocs head reinterprets alexandru lpuneanu a novella by the romanian classic costache negruzzi which romanticizes events in moldavias medieval history integrating further allusions to romanian folklore the meterul manole myth shakespeare and various others it is also seen by alina nelega as a close rendition of ion luca caragiales style the protagonist a treacherous moldavian boyar by the name of mooc uses a discourse rich in political imagery and towards the end of the play reveals himself as an alter ego of communist theorist karl marx nelega is critical of the text arguing that it does not surpass the gratuitousness of petty pokes and is more burlesque than absurd concluding i fear that grbea did not know how to end his play and quickly fabricated deus ex machina the similitude of a profound sense where there was nothing\\nthe threecharacter comedy and satire cafeaua domnului ministru seen by poet and literary chronicler emil mladin as one of morals turns its attention to romanias political scene showing the stormy encounter between a matron a female secretary and a politician the dialogues are seen by mladin as a parody of the discourses with which just about any television station assassinates us and nelega writes the lampoon has precise targets the story pokes fun at the social democratic party and romanian democratic convention governments of the post1989 period and according to dramatist and theater critic mihaela michailov was adequate in the context of 2000 elections michailov highlights the plays symbolism as illustrating the stupidity of the political mechanism whose sphere is turned into a sort of no mans land where everything is possible according to alex tefnescu productions of cafeaua domnului ministru receive as much applause as a rock music recital with leonida xxi the author returned to intertextual reworkings this time introducing his style to the works of ion luca caragiale conu leonida fa cu reaciunea and o scrisoare pierdut the play was notably used as teaching material for student actors training at the caragiale academy under mircea albulescu who called it extremely interesting\\nfrom cderea bastiliei to creterea iguanelor de cas\\nwith his debut novel cderea bastiliei grbea produces a satirical portrayal of his fellow romanian writers disguising their real names with anagrams or other word play alex tefnescu who writes that such portrayals caused great agitation in the literary world cites the authors own mockdisclaimer the identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means tefnescu however cautions against reading cderea bastiliei purely as a roman  clef since the inspiration from writers deeds is capricious and the resemblance with real persons partial a similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist cornelia maria savu who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed horia grbea does not hate his characters does not love them he understands them and by understanding them he offers them a few moments to evolve with no strings reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view paul aretzu analyzes the intrusion of intertextual indulgences throughout the work identifying allusions to ion luca caragiale franz kafka ioan alexandru brtescuvoineti and others while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing james joyces ulysses tefnescu attributes such presences to parody noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from kafkas metamorphosis and albert camus the plague\\nthe narrative delves into bucharests bohemian environment its heroes being vagrants misfits or alcoholics who lead tragicomic lifestyles the plot deemed to die for by galaicupun notably shows writer and former inmate aldu rdulescu seducing literary chronicler alteea fleciu as revenge for a negative review of his work in paul aretzus view the manner in which such developments are presented constitutes a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination he commends a chapter of the book which discusses how groups of people differentiated by their respective drinking cultures for being a sort of poem dedicated to the kinds of drink and drunks in a small alcoholic town while noting that a similar section dedicated to the attitudes of writers when faced with fatal diseases creates with the means of the grotesque a sui generis mythology of the writers caste the latter episode is praised by tefnescu for its irresistible black humor and its devilish verve the same commentator states the novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader after you finish reading this novel about the ugliness of literary life  you feel paradoxically the joy of living of communicating of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being in artezus account those parts of cderea bastiliei in which grbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a captivating humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an innocent cynicism characteristic for the author he argues with all the signs of his emotional involvement  the author also exercises through correlations and quotes the function of depersonalization of estrangement of laughing at ones misfortunes of projecting oneself into clichs  of surrogate existence literary reviewer cosmin ciotlo issues a more reserved verdict on the text in his view the episodes of cderea bastiliei are primarily charades whose main quality is being droll\\noverall horia grbeas contribution to short fiction is described by alex tefnescu as ingenious and endearing the political fiction of is described by boerescu as a multitude of subworlds structured around framework situations moving between the petty politics of the day targeting the social democratic party and ironic parables or dystopias boerescu writes the author cannot refrain from endlessly staging acts and short plays or inserting lines with an obvious dramatic hue the same commentator identifies in the stories several allusions homages or intertextual borrowings from the semiotic games of umberto eco to a landscape of luxuriant vegetation characteristic for the latin american boom writers this symbolism is coupled with allusions to romanian literary life the final story in the collection motanii din bibliotec the tomcats in the study hall speculates about the future of grbeas generation and depicts bibliophiles keeping pets named after the leading literary critics of the 1980s and 90s\\namong his poetry collections creterea iguanelor de cas drew attention for transferring the intertextual and parodic conventions into a lyrical format mostly free verse according to tefnescu it and his other poetry collections are better than those by most contemporary authors who emphatically recommend themselves as poets nicolae oprea noted in particular the reworking of a motif borrowed from sibiu circle poet tefan augustin doina and his mistreul cu coli de argint the prince from the levant whom grbea transfers into the destitute world of garbage collectors part of it reads\\noprea also highlighted ironic and dismissive borrowings from romanias national poet mihai eminescu and from poets laureate such as octavian goga and vasile alecsandri as well as an actual lineage from the black humor of 1930s surrealists he sees a direct link between grbea and the romanian surrealist groups gellu naum and beyond to the existential absurdism of ionesco and kafka also according to oprea such texts are raised as collages of everyday images and bookish suggestions well tied to each other to the point where their articulation into colloquial speech puts to use the technique of reabsorbing the dramatic element and the narrative nucleus of balladesque nature into the sphere of pure lyricism\\ncrime la elsinore and trecute viei de fani i de birlici\\ncrime la elsinore is a return to prose satire in this case directed at the theatrical environment the setting is a fictional theater in provincial clrai deriving its name from the getic ruler dromichaetes and the protagonists cosmin ciotlo notes are composite portrayals rather than the masked characters of cderea bastiliei he argues whichever way you look at it set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids the novel stands only to gain the narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager cosma who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions the project is increasingly confused and the text used by cosma mixes shakespeares lines with quotes from pierre beaumarchais euripides and molire while adopting the format of a detective novel\\nciotlo reproached crime la elsinore for lack of subtlety in the presence of a not exactly indispensable glossary of terms which was published with the book although he acknowledges that the writing is amusing he also contends that it is impossible to extend sociologically or connect to some reality being isolated in its own world and displaying compositional precariousness he concludes a book perfect in its own way but far from perfection in ours a similar overview is provided by buracernat who contends that in taking sides and explaining his intentions the author adopts the manner of an untalented journalist with seethrough results she also believes that grbeas chief comedic resource is the cheap anecdote with a trite climax which she compares with those published by the communistera magazine urzica additionally buracernat comments on the irony of cosmas reliance on intertextuality which she finds similar to grbeas own work for the stage critic andrei terian noted that he disliked almost all the book because of its authors tendency to humiliate his characters before us readers are in the least familiarized with them\\nin trecute viei de fani i de birlici grbea revisits the main themes of romanian literature looking into the biographies of various fictional characters their lifestyles personal preferences and social positioning he himself defined the overview as a sort of collection of essays on the edge of literary history one of its chapters compares the tabletop games entertaining such figures from the contract bridge parties in camil petrescus books and the antiquated card games in mateiu caragiales craii de curteaveche to the cruder craps and gambling preferred by thieves in eugen barbus novels other sections discuss the attitudes toward love in such diverse places as marin sorescus neorealist prose and the fantasy short stories of mircea eliade likewise the avatars of violence are depicted between ion luca caragiales satire dale carnavalului where people threaten to poison each other with sulfuric acid anton bacalbaas depictions of officers disciplining their subordinates with the use of belts and marin predas moromeii where peasants beat each other with clubs another part of the book deals with the incidence of failure among intellectual protagonists and leads grbea to conclude that with the exception of mihail sebastians accidentul romanian narratives generally show their intellectual protagonists incapable of finding their way in life according to daniel cristeaenache grbea generally and willingly limited the scope of his investigation to canonical and urbane literary realism avoiding allegorical styles such as onirism the author is not interested in symbolic codification in the refraction of the characters and their fictional world but quite the contrary in the points and lines at which literature intersects with social life\\nin his review of the volume emil mladin deemed it wonderful and an extremely welcome project noting trecute viei de fani i de birlici represents a link which the reader needed in his relationship with the characters of stories relevant both at the time of their writing and today according to literary critic silvia dumitrache the book creates new paths in interpretation  even when starting from literary locations that are often threatened with turning into clichs she concludes through the playful note he impresses on the book horia grbea proves that his main intention does not reside in the willingness to impose a new hermeneutic grid on romanian literature but in the attempt to demonstrate that the resources of literature can never ever be entirely exhausted cristeaenache sees in trecute viei de fani i de birlici a book as interesting as it is enjoyable  a holiday read one could say had this sytagm not been bastardized in our country by so many printed works volumes and journals alike that offend the readers intellect\\noutside the critical reevaluation of local literature grbeas work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post1989 society and modern romanian culture one such chapter is built around the polemic between grbea and writer gheorghe grigurcu over the issue of what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the romanian lexis with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as sal for salut hello vb vorbim well talk and ms mersi thanks grbea also pokes fun at the babytalkbased jargon of parenting magazines and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son tudor it reads he does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of the unknown when i call him using his human name he smiles down on me with devastating irony so that i may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability no matter what will happen in the future these winter days  shall always remain for me under the sign of having met for the first time in life an inexplicable creature\\nother works\\nfratele mai detept al lui kalanikov which comprises several stories received mixed reviews according to andrei terian the main one articolul 96 article 96 which is about a lecherous politician dating an anorexic model has the same defects as crime in contrast terian notes grbea shows his sure hand in other pieces where he parodies povestea unui om lene the story of a lazy man by 19th century romanian classic ion creang or where he pokes fun at the 14th century battle of rovine as well as the absurdist ntoarcerea tatei din rzboi subiecte fathers return from war subjects where the same narrative clich is explored from several conflicting perspectives according to terian the volume as a whole displays influences from poet and satirist tudor arghezi as well as borrowings from fellow parodist ioan groan\\nazerbaijan  the living flame details grbeas trip and offers additional insight into the nagornokarabakh conflict between azerbaijani people and armenians it features his poems about shusha city the khojaly massacre and the guba mass grave the

grbeas claim that heydar aliyev was a civilizing providential hero'}, {'title': 'M._R._James', 'label': 'Writer', 'text': 'montague rhodes james 1 august 1862  12 june 1936 was an english author medievalist scholar and provost of kings college cambridge 19051918 and of eton college 19181936 he was vicechancellor of the university of cambridge 191315\\njamess work as a medievalist and scholar is still highly regarded but he is best remembered for his ghost stories which some consider among the best in the genre he redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal gothic clichs of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings however his protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests accordingly he is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story\\nearly life\\njames was born in a clergy house in goodnestone dover kent england although his parents had associations with aldeburgh in suffolk his father was herbert james an evangelical anglican clergyman and his mother mary emily ne horton was the daughter of a naval officer he had two older brothers sydney and herbert nicknamed ber and an older sister grace sydney james later became archdeacon of dudley from the age of three 1865 until 1909 jamess home if not always his residence was at the rectory in great livermere suffolk this had previously been the childhood home of another eminent suffolk antiquary thomas martin of palgrave 16961771 several of jamess ghost stories are set in suffolk including oh whistle and ill come to you my lad felixstowe a warning to the curious aldeburgh rats and a vignette great livermere\\nin september 1873 he arrived as a boarder at temple grove school in east sheen in west london one of the leading boys preparatory schools of the day from september 1876 to august 1882 he studied at eton college where he claims to have translated the book of baruch from its original ethiopic in 1879 he lived for many years first as an undergraduate 18821885 then as a don and provost at kings college cambridge where he was also a member of the pitt club the university provides settings for several of his tales apart from medieval subjects james toured europe often including a memorable 1884 tour of france in a cheylesmore tricycle studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of aristophanes play the birds with music by hubert parry his ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at christmas time\\nscholarly works\\njames is best known for his ghost stories but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles indeed the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge his discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at bury st edmunds west suffolk in 1902 in which the graves of several twelfthcentury abbots described by jocelyn de brakelond a contemporary chronicler were rediscovered having been lost since the dissolution of the monasteries he published a detailed description of the sculptured ceiling bosses of the cloisters of norwich cathedral in 1911 this included drawings of all the bosses in the north walk by c j w winter his 1917 edition of the latin hagiography of thelberht ii of east anglia king and martyr remains authoritative\\nhe catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the university of cambridge among his other scholarly works he wrote the apocalypse in art which placed the english apocalypse manuscripts into families he also translated the new testament apocrypha and contributed to the encyclopaedia biblica 1903 his ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his suffolk and norfolk dent 1930 in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form and in abbeys\\nhe also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge 18931908 he managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts including notable portraits by titian\\njames was provost of eton college from 1918 to 1936 he was awarded the order of merit in 1930 he died in 1936 age 73 and was buried in eton town cemetery\\nghost stories\\njamess ghost stories were published in a series of collections ghost stories of an antiquary 1904 more ghost stories of an antiquary 1911 a thin ghost and others 1919 and a warning to the curious and other ghost stories 1925 the first hardback collected edition appeared in 1931 many of the tales were written as christmas eve entertainments and read aloud to friends this idea was used by the bbc in 2000 when they filmed christopher lee reading jamess stories in a candlelit room in kings college\\njames perfected a method of storytelling which has since become known as jamesian the classic jamesian tale usually includes the following elements\\naccording to james the story must put the reader into the position of saying to himself if im not very careful something of this kind may happen to me he also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion letting his reader fill in the blanks and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief he summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology ghosts and marvels two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are to me the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo  let us then be introduced to the actors in a placid way let us see them going about their ordinary business undisturbed by forebodings pleased with their surroundings and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head unobtrusively at first and then more insistently until it holds the stage\\nhe also noted another requisite in my opinion is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends but i have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story\\ndespite his suggestion in the essay stories i have tried to write that writers employ reticence in their work many of jamess tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence for example in lost hearts pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their stillliving bodies in a 1929 essay james stated\\nreticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach yet from the artistic point of view i am sure it is a sound one reticence conduces to effect blatancy ruins it and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories they drag in sex too which is a fatal mistake sex is tiresome enough in the novels in a ghost story or as the backbone of a ghost story i have no patience with it at the same time dont let us be mild and drab malevolence and terror the glare of evil faces the stony grin of unearthly malice pursuing forms in darkness and longdrawn distant screams are all in place and so is a modicum of blood shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded the weltering and wallowing that i too often encounter merely recall the methods of m g lewis\\nalthough not overtly sexual plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the freudian variety jamess biographer michael cox wrote in m r james an informal portrait 1983 one need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check reviewing this biography daily telegraph 1983 the novelist and diarist anthony powell who attended eton under jamess tutelage commented that i myself have heard it suggested that jamess of course platonic love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch powell was referring to jamess relationships with his pupils not his peers\\nother critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in jamess work his authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by julia briggs in night visitors the rise and fall of the english ghost story 1977 as nigel kneale wrote in the introduction to the folio society edition of ghost stories of m r james in an age where every man is his own psychologist m r james looks like rich and promising material  there must have been times when it was hard to be monty james or to put it another way although james conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality generally sketched in with the lightest of pens\\nin addition to writing his own stories james championed the works of sheridan le fanu whom he viewed as absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories editing and supplying introductions to madame crowls ghost 1923 and uncle silas 1926\\njamess statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts are ambiguous he wrote i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me\\nviews on literature and politics\\njames held strongly traditional views about literature in addition to ghost stories he also enjoyed reading the work of william shakespeare and the detective stories of agatha christie he disliked most contemporary literature strongly criticising the work of aldous huxley lytton strachey and james joyce whom he called a charlatan and that prostitutor of life and language he also supported the banning of radclyffe halls 1928 novel about lesbianism the well of loneliness stating i believe miss halls book is about birth control or some kindred subject isnt it i find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature\\nwhen he was a student at kings james had opposed the appointment of thomas henry huxley as provost of eton because of huxleys agnosticism he later became provost of eton himself in his later life james showed little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues however he often spoke out against the irish home rule movement and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for communism his friend a c benson considered him to be reactionary and against modernity and progress\\nreception and influence\\nh p lovecraft was an admirer of jamess work extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay supernatural horror in literature 1927 another renowned fan of james in the horror and fantasy genre was clark ashton smith who wrote an essay on him michael sadleir described james as the best ghoststory writer england has ever produced marjorie bowen also admired his work referring to his ghost stories as the supreme art of m r james mary butts another admirer wrote the first critical essay on his work the art of montagu james in the february 1934 issue of the london mercury manly wade wellman esteemed his fiction in the great railway bazaar paul theroux refers to the mezzotint as the most frightening story i know in his list the 13 most terrifying horror stories t e d klein placed jamess casting the runes at number one e f bleiler stated that james is in the opinion of many the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction and he described ghost stories of an antiquary as one of the landmark books in the history of supernatural fiction and characterised the stories in jamess other collections as firstrate stories and excellent stories ruth rendell has also expressed admiration for jamess work stating there are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time for me m r james is one of these david langford has described james as the author of the 20th centurys most influential canon of ghost stories\\nsir john betjeman in an introduction to peter hainings book about james shows how influenced he was by jamess work\\nin the year 1920 i was a new boy at the dragon school oxford then called lynams of which the headmaster was c c lynam known as the skipper he dressed and looked like an old sea salt and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire i remember he told the stories as having happened to himself  they were the best stories i ever heard and gave me an interest in old churches and country houses and scandinavia that not even the mighty hans christian andersen eclipsed\\nbetjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of m r james\\nh russell wakefields supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of james a large number of british writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the jamesian style these writers sometimes described as the james gang include a n l munby e g swain ingulphus pseudonym of sir arthur gray 18521940 amyas northcote and r h malden although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of james himself although most of the early jamesian writers were male there were several notable female writers of such fiction including eleanor scott pseudonym of helen m leys 18921965 in the stories of her book randalls round 1929 and d k broster in the collection couching at the door strange and macabre tales 1942 l t c rolt also modelled his ghost stories on jamess work but unlike other jamesian writers set them in industrial locations such as mines and railways\\njamess stories continue to influence many of todays great supernatural writers including stephen king who discusses james in the 1981 nonfiction book danse macabre and ramsey campbell who edited meddling with ghosts stories in the tradition of m r james and wrote the short story the guide in tribute the author john bellairs paid homage to james by incorporating plot elements borrowed from jamess ghost stories into

{'title': 'Mersha_Nahusenay', 'label': 'Writer', 'text': 'mersha nahusenay  1850  1937 was a reformist and pioneer of change who made important contributions to the modernization and independence of ethiopia one of the closest advisors to emperor menelik ii he went on to become the first governor of dire dawa and surrounding areas 19021905 prior to that he was governor of the strategic and frontier district of jaldessa gildessa and its environ where he also held the position of head of customs his public career lasted over three decades from the era of menelik ii referred to in historical records as menilek until the reign of haile selassie he was one of the most recognized ethiopians of his time he knew the french language and was open to european ideas and way of life earning him admiration abroad his most enduring legacy was the construction maintenance and security of the first railway which he oversaw at the request of the emperor mersha belongs to a generation who took advantage of the relative stability of the late 19th  early 20th century to implement a series of wideranging political economic and social reforms which put the country on the path to modernization ushering in a new era\\nearly life\\nchildhood and formative years\\nato mr mersha nahusenay    was born about 1850 near the town of ankober the former capital of shewa\\naccording to oral history mersha came from a family of priests his parents were strict followers of the ethiopian orthodox faith and religion played a central role in their life mershas childhood was hence heavily influenced by events involving the church where he was also baptized family lore further indicates that his father owned a land given to him in return for the service he rendered to the church in addition to holding lands churches at the time received considerable assistance from the royal palace which they then used to provide key services to their members and communities including the education of children thus mersha was taught reading and writing at an early age and received traditional church education whether or not he had any siblings remains unknown although the name mersha in the amharic language implies a desire to forget a traumatic experience such as the loss of a previous child\\ngrowing up mersha spent a great deal of time on the farm with his parents he traveled to various places within shewa and beyond allowing him to interact with a diverse group of people and explore opportunities which existed for a career in a secular field for example early on he learned to appreciate the importance local as well as foreign languages beyond these sketchy details little is known about mershas early life at this point it is unclear for example if he had royal ancestry the fact that he was later married to the daughter of one of meneliks trusted servants suggests however that the family had close ties to the palace\\noverall there is little doubt that mershas formative and early adulthood experiences helped him prepare for his long and illustrious public career its worth noting that today ankober is one of many districts woredas of ethiopia but back then it was the capital of one of several powerful kingdoms the following quote encapsulates the vitality of the ankober area at the time\\nthe early nineteenthcentury shawan royal capital of ankober was a spectacular sight perched at 2400 meters atop a volcanic cone above the steep escarpment of the eastern highlands it commanded a prosperous cosmopolitan and culturally diverse polity founded as a frontier outpost in the lateeighteenth century fifty years later ankober stood amidst a rich agricultural area and controlled the red sea trade through regional markets such as aliyu amba visited by muslim merchants and traders from the mediterranean and a busy ecclesiastical base of orthodox theology ankober was a lively commercial and intellectual center\\nby mid19th century ankober had established trade and diplomatic ties with the outside world as a result there was strong public interest in international affairs foreign languages history geography and medicine as well as the design manufacturing and function of machines and tools as documented by missionaries \\nunder menelik the last ruler of shewa 18651889 ankober rapidly evolved into a vibrant political and economic center trade was expanded to the gulf of aden and the red sea via harar\\nmersha also grew up in one of the most consequential periods in the nations history the second half of the nineteenth century was a turning point in the sense that it marked the end a long period of deep divisions within and between the various kingdoms located in the northern part of the country known as the era of princes or zemene mesafint 17691855 emperor tewodros tewodros ii was the first ruler 18551868 in the modern era to try and unify the northern kingdoms included in tewodros vision also was the introduction of europeanstyle civilization his efforts were cut short however by internal resistance and external challenges as well as his untimely death emperor yohannes yohannes iv further pursued the unification agenda during his reign 18721889 but he was unfortunately killed in a war with mahdist sudan emperor menelik ii 18891913 his successor the fortunate one to realize the dreams of his predecessors and much more he succeeded in bringing together under a central authority northern and southern territories through a combination of diplomacy and military campaigns he was able to create a new empire paving the way for the emergence of modern ethiopia\\nmeneliks extraordinary achievements including his leadership in the decisive victory over italy at adwa in 1896 enabled him to put the country on the path to stability and modernization according to the prominent ethiopian historian tekletsadiq mekuria meneliks top priorities included negotiating ethiopias borders with the three european colonial powers ie france britain and italy who controlled much of eastern africa securing access to the gulf of aden and the red sea as a way of improving trade relations with europe and beyond maintaining security and stability across the vast empire implementing wideranging political economic and social reforms and building ethiopias image abroad\\nas will be seen below mersha was at the forefront of most if not all of these undertakings he answered repeated calls for public service and rose to the occasion by taking on challenging tasks more importantly he was a strong advocate for reform and europeanstyle modernization the renowned ethiopian historian tekletsadiq mekuria wrote in his book atse menilek and the unity of ethiopia\\n                                                       \\nenglish translation \\nthus after listening to the advice of these and other personal foreign advisors and taking into account the views of those who had travelled abroad and returned with

menelik decided to introduce european civilization to his country\\nlater life\\nwhether mersha nahusenay held any official government positions before menelik ii became emperor of ethiopia in 1889 remains unknown what is evident from historical records is sometime in the early 1890s at the age of about 40 he left his birthplace and settled in the harar province by then ankober had declined in part due to the rise of addis abeba addis ababa as the new capital of ethiopia founded in 1886 by menelik and his influential wife empress taytu betul 18511918\\ngovernor of jaldessa and head of imperial customs\\nmershas relocation to harar marked the beginning of his long and distinguished career by some accounts as early as 1892 but surely by 1895 he was appointed governor of jaldessa gildessa jildessa guildessa gheldessa a historic and strategic district near the present city of harar according to one source at the time jaldessa had approximately 6000 inhabitants at the time compared to 8000 in the port city of djibouti and 30000 in harar not only was jaldessa a frontier town to meneliks empire but it was also located along an important caravan route connecting ethiopia with the gulf of aden and the red sea coast as a result all visitors were required to pass through an armed and customs post established there by the ethiopian authority and administered by mersha as chief of customs jaldessa mersha oversaw the import of all goods caravans were stopped and inspected import duty of 10 per cent was levied on merchandise generating important revenue for the empire the economic value of jaldessa grew considerably after the port of djibouti became operational however it sharply declined following the founding of dire dawa in 1902\\nas governor mersha controlled and administered a vast area between ethiopian borders with the french and british somalilands and the awash river the territory was inhabited by somalis oromos afars and other ethnic groups he served under ras mekonnen woldemichael makonnen wolde mikael who was governor of harar province until his untimely death in 1906 the armenian serkis terzian 18681915 served as governor of jaldessa before him terzian a personality well known to scholars of ethiopian history served menelik in various capacities including the import of arms and ammunition apparently there was confusion at times about who owned what on one occasion mersha confiscated arms claimed by terzian according to distinguished historian richard pankhurst lord hindlip a british businessman and adventurer and a member of an angloamerican expedition described his visit to mershas residence as follows\\nhe received us in his official residence a small circular hut with the usual pointed roof built on a conical hill his furniture consisted of a table chair two beds a photograph of an abyssinian priest and a coloured crucification while his rifle shield and revolver were hung on the walls\\nfurthermore jaldessa was at the center of international negotiations between menelik and the three colonial powers article 3 of the 1897 treaty signed between britain and ethiopia for example stated that the route between zeyla zeila and harar via gildessa should remain open for the commercial interests of the two countries mersha was regularly consulted on relevant matters he was also directly responsible for implementation of agreements for instance in 1896 he hosted cyrille macaire kyrillos makarios a coptic egyptian bishop who came as a special envoy of pope leo xiii to plead with menelik to free the italian prisoners from the battle of adwa when the prisoners were freed ultimately they were brought to an area near gildessa to meet with an italian red cross team before being transported to harar for safe return to italy mersha visited djibouti on several occasions including at the request of emperor menelik his knowledge of french was invaluable during his foreign trips\\npromoter of the progressive image of ethiopia\\nfollowing the victory at adwa 1896 there was a heightened global interest in strengthening diplomatic and trade relations with ethiopia a large number of foreign nationals including diplomats journalists writers scientists and explorers visited the empire the visitors were intrigued by meneliks wisdom and accomplishments realizing the significance of the moment for the future the emperor was equally determined to build a progressive image of his nation what better place to create a good first impression than the frontier town of jaldessa lord edward gleichen the british courtier officer and author who visited ethiopia in 1897 and who was a member of sir rennell rodds diplomatic mission wrote the following\\nnext day we made a long march of twentyfour miles over stony country to garasle a pretty little river three inches deep running between high banks and a three hours march on the following morning brought us to gildessa here we were received in great state by the governor one aito merzha ie ato mersha who to impress on us that we were now on abyssinian territory had turned out a guard of about a dozen men all armed with rifles and carrying the abyssinian flag the latter i fear did not impress us much as it only consisted of triangular yellow red and green pennons nailed on a thin and crooked stick but the guard of honour was very beautiful\\nmost visitors came to the country through the gulf of aden and the red sea and many camped at jaldessa for at least a day before traveling further to addis abeba harar or other parts of the new empire thus mersha was tasked with providing logistical and other forms of assistance to the guests he was uniquely positioned to meet and interact with a large number of europeans and other foreign nationals in an article published in le figaro april 1901 the french journalist and author hughes le roux noted the following after a long discussion with mersha\\nje ne sais si ce sage a lu candide mais depuis les annes dj longues que le roi des rois lui a confi la clef de la premire poterne de lempire il a vu dfiler beaucoup dhommes de toutes couleurs de tous pays de toutes langues\\nenglish translation\\ni do not know if this wise man read candide but since for many years the king of kings has given him the key to the first gate of the empire he had seen people of all colors all countries and all languages\\nthe following is a partial list of notables who have either interacted with or hosted by mersha at gildessa or dire dawa\\ndespite robust diplomatic efforts by menelik and his domestic as well as foreign advisors there was a great deal of skepticism initially among many europeans that ethiopia was ready to embrace modernization in an article titled the menelik myth published in 1899 for example vicomte edmond de poncins the wealthy french naturalist and explorer concluded\\nthe history of ethiopia then may be summed up thus a country in which communications are difficult peopled by a multiplicity of races its internal life presents ever the same cycle of wars victories defeats its external life the same blank a real civilization is impossible in that black chaos and the products of civilization such as agriculture invention commerce do not exist\\nin contrast there were those who offered unwavering support for the expansion of trade and investment in ethiopia meneliks closest european advisors such as the swiss engineer alfred ilg and the french trader leon chefneux chief commerce advisor were incontestably at the top of the list mersha worked closely with both of them but there were others as well casimir mondonvidailhet the french journalist and contributor to the le temps was another important figure who played a major role in advancing ethiofrench relations due to his passion for horticulture mondonvidailhet may have also played a role in popularizing the eucalyptus tree   he also studied local languages eg amharic guraghe harari etc and wrote books about them more relevantly mondonvidailhet helped advance the progressive image of menelik and ethiopia in europe and the united states he did this primarily through his speeches and writings in an interview that he gave to the new york times in 1898 mondon defended ethiopias records and potential\\nthe country lends itself easily to civilization and its organization still encumbered by feudal relations tends more and more to become modelled on the lines of european constitutional monarchies menelek powerful and respected an enlightened reformer and administrator who abolished slavery in his dominions and dislikes fanatics to whatever sect they belong has revealed himself as a really great sovereign worthy of admiration by his conduct as well as by the dignity of his character\\nmersha was a strong proponent of opening ethiopia to the world he encouraged modern education and supported missionary schools in harar he encouraged trade ties with europe

was the construction of ethiopias first railway the agreement to create a company for the construction of the railroad was first signed in 1894 between menelik and alfred ilg the primary european

frgabriel angoulvantgabriel louis angoulvant acting governorgeneral of the french somaliland as well representatives of shareholders and other domestic and foreign diplomats including ato yosef zagalan the ethiopian consul in djibouti and a dear friend of mersha according to one source emperor menelik himself was to be present but he changed his mind later in protest of the growing interference by the french government in the affairs of the compagnie imperiale dethiopie to which he granted concession things became worse and the construction was interrupted for several years following the completion of the djiboutidire dawa line when the work resumed in 1909 mersha was once again called to serve the task given to him and other local officials was to oversee the extension

historian richard pankhurst called the first railway the countrys greatest technological achievement of the period it led to rapid expansion of domestic and foreign trade by cutting the amount of travel time to the coast in half for example the railroad increased the import and export of commodities drastically it accelerated the process of urbanization as it paved the way to the rise of new settlements and villages and transformation of towns such as harar and addis abeba the movement of people from south to north and vice versa grew considerably in short the railway made life better for hundreds of thousands if not millions of ethiopians more importantly it connected the country to the sea robert p skinner the diplomat who led the first us mission in 190304 noted the following about the importance of the railway to the economy\\nthe customhouse figures show a movement of importations and exportations in 1902 amounting 1659800 but having in mind the methods of appraisement and the possibility of entering goods in contraband it may be conservatively stated that the total trade under present conditions amounts to 3000000 per annum henceforth this trade will grow rapidly although the full power of the country will not be appreciated until the railroad is extended to the capital 300 miles distant from its present terminus\\nspinner further observed \\nwhen the railroad connecting the empire and the sea was projected a route was naturally selected which should give the greatest advantages to commercea town was created at this point to which was given the name dire douah and it has already become an important business center\\npioneer and the first governor of dire dawa\\nthe conclusion of the djiboutidire dawa railway in 1902 marked the birth of dire dawa the second largest city in ethiopia shortly after mersha was ordered to move the jaldessa custom house and his residence to the new terminus making him the first governor of the railway city not only he was at the right place at the right time but this was a natural extension of his administrative responsibilities getahun mesfin haile an expert on the history of dire dawa wrote\\nbefore the foundation of the town the whole frontier region up to dawale including the great environ of dire dawa used to be administered by a governor whose seat normally was at jeldessa a few km to the east of dire dawa in 1902 the governor was one mersha nahusenay an educated and also french speaking personality who took a considerable part in the foundation of the station and eventually of the town\\nhe went on to say\\nthe earliest town quarters of kzira and mgala which sprang up following the establishment by the railway company of a station and its main workshop soon evolved into the two most important nodes of economic social and administrative activities of the new town kzira was built according to a regular plan and well provided with modern amenities in the meantime ato mrsha nahusnay the first governor and his followers cleared and settled an area of land across from kzira on the opposite side of the dchatu that was largely covered with dense brush and cacti then growing out of this nucleus the larger quarter of mgala took shape by degrees in fact the present quarter of dchatu used to be known as gndmrsha in the past in honor of its illustrious resident and founder\\nthus it didnt take long before residential communities appeared and roads offices and workshops as well as other critical facilities were built under the leadership of leon chefneux and mersha in the first several years of its founding residents of the new town and the francoethiopian railway company were able to lay the foundation for what later became a frenchstyle cosmopolitan city sadly unlike other towns foreigners and locals did not live in the same area kezira or gezira became a european quarter while megala was inhabited by natives\\nrichard pankhurst called dire dawa ethiopias first modern town not only dire dawa was built differently than other towns of the time but its administration was also unique historian shiferaw bekele noted\\nthe officials shared certain important characteristics which sharply set them apart from the general run of ethiopian officialdom at the time almost in every province one would meet one or two men who belonged to this category however in no other much concentration as in dire dawa\\nshiferaw who is an expert on the early history of dire dawa went on to say \\nthe dire dawan officialdom invariably spoke at least one european language even the earliest mersha spoke french a good number of them were highly educated afework gebre yesus and gebre hiwot baykedagn who were the directors of customs had had long years of stay in europe where they had attained a tertiary level education beshah wured was educated in the united states the rest had gone to mission schools\\nmersha served as governor from 1902 until 1906 he was in charge of administrative as well as judicial affairs he even held courts under a tree in the early years of his tenure he was succeeded by ato negatu gugsa the dire dawa municipality did not emerge until sometime between 1915 and 1920\\nchief of railway security\\nthe agreements signed by the ethiopian government and the railway company required ethiopia to deploy a police force to safeguard the line and safety of employees the mission was extremely dangerous due to local hostilities mersha became head of railway security fulltime in 1906 his strategy for success included working with local chiefs and leaders in fact he also assumed the position of chief of the issa territory which much of the opposition to the construction came from shiferaw bekele wrote\\nas the governor of the province through with the line passed he ie ato mersha was responsible for the peace and security of the line he posted detachments of troops all along the line he carried out negotiations with all the important chiefs of the afar and somali tribes in the region he received orders from ras mekonnen and from menelik\\nhe was in charge of the recruitment training of the security personnel negotiated their wage with the company and settled disputes he had always been the middle man between the railway company and ethiopians that involved making sure that the company honored its contractual

issa the company paying 12 dollars per month for each abyssinian soldier now the company paid them 8 dollars instead of 12 dollars and the abyssinians have withdrawn these 200 men\\nhis prior experience as chief of harar police must have prepared him for the challenges of the position the railway police was in charge of stability and peace dire dawa and its surroundings as well which he held until the mid1920s with the exception of his brief dismissal by lij iyasu in 1916\\nthe dawn of modernization\\nthe desire to introduce european style modernization was not unique to emperor menelik ii however it was under him that the country took important practical steps in terms of establishing modern institutions and structure of governance transport and communication got a huge boost the first telephone and telegraph were introduced following the first railway major roads were built and bicycles and automobiles appeared for the first time the tax system was restructured a modern monetary system was created the first bank bank of abyssinia was established a national currency was launched the governance system underwent significant reorganization the first cabinet of ministers was formed each of the six districts had two judges appointed by menelik himself the position of a supreme judge was created the first public schools the first newspaper the first hotels the first hospitals and post offices emerged the list goes on although mersha was principally involved in the construction of the railway and establishment of modern customs he also participated in other important reforms such as the creation of postal and telegraph services\\nafter menelik died in 1913 following a long illness his grandson iyasu v became the de facto ruler mersha was about sixty years of age at the time\\nduring his brief reign 19131916 iyasu seems to have continued some of the reforms that he inherited however he also made political miscalculations resulting in his removal from power in 1915 for example iyasu appointed hasib ydlibi or idlibi a syrian merchant of turkish citizenship as governor of dire dawa and neggadras of harar the appointment was kept secret from dejazmach teferi tafari mekonnen his cousin and governor of harar province \\nbut then in july 1916 a few months before his ouster iyasu took the unprecedented step of deposing teferi from his governorship creating further tensions between them and leading to anger in a province traditionally governed by that family\\niyasu also seem to have chosen a foreign policy which sought to alienate traditional allies such as france and strengthen relations with germany and turkey then ottoman empire perhaps because of that he went on to remove mersha from his post at the railway and replace him with abubakar mahammad another important historic figure in ethiopian history ironically just months before their dismissal both dejach teferi and mersha had accompanied iyasu during his trip to the region along with a number of other notables including mikael berru a german educated british agency interpreter and father of the sorbonne graduate lij seifu mikael and tesemma eshete the radical changes were quickly picked up by foreign media\\nthe sudden change was picked up by international media and largely interpreted as a plan to favor muslims over christians a sentiment shared by many in the country\\nsuddenly at the end of last july yasu left adis abeba for harrar and came on to jibuti on august 8th where he renewed his protestations of friendship to m simoni governor of french somaliland  he was found to have deposed prince taffari son of ras makonnen from the governorship of harrar and substituted a muhammadan intrigue was rampant at harrar under the turk ydlibi and finally the chief of the issas ato marcha was deposed in favour of a muhammadan these events caused a stir at adis abeba the legations of the entente powers also sent in a protest and on september 27thlij yasu was formally deposed\\nthe situation however was much more complex than what the reports claimed there is no doubt that iyasu tried to nurture close relations with the muslim community and was married fatima the daughter of abubakar raising questions about his intentions and vision abubakar came from a family of rich muslim afar traders who made enormous contributions to menelik commercially administratively and diplomatically his father mahammad also negaddras was the governor of the historic town of aliyu amba shoa province while he himself served as the governor of shenno another commercial center his grandfather abubakar ibrahim chehem was a notable statesman and sultan or pasha of somalias port city of zeila zeyla before it became part of the british somaliland\\nin contrast some scholars argue today that the new policies were all part of iyasus efforts to consolidate the imperial power such as by integrating marginal territories such as the afar land\\nfrom the end of the 19th century the members of this family lost their role as obligatory intermediaries in favour of european traders supported by their respective states however one of them naggadras mahammad abubakar continued to enjoy the trust of menelik who was unwilling to rely solely on the europeans\\n furthermore although mersha was christian he did not adhere to the historically dominant orthodox faith rather he was one of the first to convert to catholicism and subjected to mistreament like many of his fellow worshippers\\nmershas absence was a source of great concern to the railway company in part due to his long and dedicated service and reputation this was obvious from one of the letters that emperor menelik wrote to him the following comment made by mr de mazrieux the companys administrator captures that sentiment\\navec ato marcha qui tait au courant des usages et des mthodes de la cie et qui lui tait surtout absolumment dvou les difficults etaient rapidement aplanies aboubaker est trop connu en abyssinie et  la cie pour quon puisse esprer quil en sera de mme avec lui\\nenglish translation \\nwith ato marcha who was very knowledgeable of the practices and methods of cie ie compagnie imperiale dethiopie and who was absolutely devoted difficulties were quickly resolved abubaker is very well known in abyssinia and cie so we hope that things will be the same with him\\nmersha was restored to his position under empress zewditu meneliks daughter who ruled ethiopia from 1916 until 1930 teferi mekonnen was regent to the throne during this period and went

catholics form a distinct subgroup within the larger community of educated men also known as la jeune ethiopie however the historic ties between catholic and orthodox christian intellectuals have also been stressed by mickael as well other scholars \\nthe ethiopian roman catholic community the first of whose members were converted in the late 19th century by italian or french missionaries such as guglielmo massaia and andr jarosseau included zwg haylu who attended the paris exposition universelle of 1900 and mrsha nahu snay who represented menelik at the ceremony marking the completion of the jibuti railway as far as the ethiopian frontier in 1902 the community thus came into existence at the very same time as the emergence of the young ethiopians as a whole the catholic community was

serious setbacks in the two decades after the 1974 popular revolution primarily due to severe droughts and civil war but also bad policies the country underwent a radical transformation the revolution has ended the feudal  system paving the way for greater participation of people in political and economic activities during the past several decades ethiopia has witnessed unprecedented economic development characterized by a strong government sector expanding private sector and major development of critical infrastructure eg roads new djiboutiaddis railway etc whether or this momentum will be maintained time will tell when all is said and done however there is general consensus that much of the progress made over the last century is deeply rooted in the historic events and reforms of

shower ed gein wasnt into taxidermy ed gein didnt stuff his mother keep her body in the house dress in a drag outfit or adopt an alternative personality these were the functions and characteristics of

result of what went on during world war ii and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology that the real horror is not in the shadows but in that twisted little world inside our own

and the reissued version of her first book under the sea wind were also bestsellers this sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths \\nlate in the 1950s carson turned her attention to conservation especially some problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides the result was the book silent spring 1962 which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the american people although silent spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy which led to a nationwide ban on ddt and other pesticides it also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the us environmental protection agency carson was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom by president jimmy carter\\nlife and work\\nearly life and education\\nrachel carson was born on may 27 1907 on a family farm near springdale pennsylvania just up the allegheny river from pittsburgh she was the daughter of maria frazier mclean and robert warden carson an insurance salesman she spent a lot of time exploring around her familys farm an avid reader she began writing stories often involving animals at age eight she had her first story published at age ten she especially enjoyed the st nicholas magazine which carried her first published stories the works of beatrix potter and the novels of gene strattonporter and in her teen years herman melville joseph conrad and robert louis stevenson the natural world particularly the ocean was the common thread of her favorite literature carson attended springdales small school through tenth grade then completed high school in nearby parnassus pennsylvania graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of fortyfour students\\nat the pennsylvania college for women today known as chatham university as in high school carson was somewhat of a loner she originally studied english but switched her major to biology in january 1928 however she continued contributing to the schools student newspaper and literary supplement though admitted to graduate standing at johns hopkins university in 1928 she was forced to remain at the pennsylvania college for women for her senior year due to financial difficulties she graduated magna cum laude in 1929 after a summer course at the marine biological laboratory she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at johns hopkins in the fall of 1929\\nafter her first year of graduate school carson became a parttime student taking an assistantship in raymond pearls laboratory where she worked with rats and drosophila to earn money for tuition after false starts with pit vipers and squirrels she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish she earned a masters degree in zoology in june 1932 she had intended to continue for a doctorate however in 1934 carson was forced to leave johns hopkins to search for a fulltime teaching position to help support her family during the great depression in 1935 her father died suddenly worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving carson to care for her aging mother at the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor mary scott skinker she settled for a temporary position with the us bureau of fisheries writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled romance under the waters the series of 52 sevenminute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and the bureaus work a task the several writers before carson had not managed carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the chesapeake bay based on her research for the series to local newspapers and magazines\\ncarsons supervisor pleased with the success of the radio series asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau he also worked to secure her the first fulltime position that became available sitting for the civil service exam she outscored all other applicants and in 1936 became the second woman hired by the bureau of fisheries for a fulltime professional position as a junior aquatic biologist\\nearly career and publications\\nat the us bureau of fisheries carsons primary responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations and write brochures and other literature for the public using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points she also wrote a steady stream of articles for the baltimore sun and other newspapers however her family responsibilities further increased in january 1937 when her older sister died leaving carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces\\nin july 1937 the atlantic monthly accepted a revised version of an essay the world of waters that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose the essay published as undersea was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor it marked a major turning point in carsons writing career publishing house simon amp schuster impressed by undersea contacted carson and suggested that she expand it into a book several years of writing resulted in under the sea wind 1941 which received excellent reviews but sold poorly in the meantime carsons articlewriting success continuedher features appeared in sun magazine nature and colliers carson attempted to leave the bureau by then transformed into the united states fish and wildlife service in 1945 however few jobs for naturalists were available as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the manhattan project in mid1945 carson first encountered the subject of ddt a revolutionary new pesticidelauded as the insect bomb after the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasakithat was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and ecological effects ddt was but one of carsons many writing interests at the time and editors found the subject unappealing she published nothing on ddt until 1962\\ncarson rose within the fish and wildlife service by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects however it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities by 1948 carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing fulltime that year she took on a literary agent marie rodell they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of carsons career\\noxford university press expressed interest in carsons book proposal for a life history of the ocean spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become the sea around us chapters appeared in science digest and the yale reviewthe latter chapter the birth of an island winning the american association for the advancement of sciences george westinghouse science writing prize nine chapters were serialized in the new yorker beginning june 1951 the book was published july 2 1951 by oxford university press the sea around us remained on the new york times best seller list for 86 weeks was abridged by readers digest won the 1952 national book award for nonfiction and the john burroughs medal and resulted in carsons being awarded two honorary doctorates she also licensed a documentary film based on it the sea success led to the republication of under the sea wind which became a bestseller itself with success came financial security and in 1952 carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing fulltime\\ncarson was inundated with speaking engagements fan mail and other correspondence regarding the sea around us along with work on the script that she had secured the right to review she was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer director and producer irwin allen she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing describing it as a cross between a believeitornot and a breezy travelogue however she discovered that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content this led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film despite carsons requests to resolve these problems allen went forward with the script he succeeded in producing a very successful documentary it went on to win the 1953 academy award for best documentary feature however carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work\\nrelationship with dorothy freeman\\ncarson first met dorothy freeman in the summer of 1953 in southport island maine freeman had written to carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor it was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of carsons life their relationship was conducted mainly through letters and during summers spent together in maine over 12 years they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters many of these were published in the book always rachel published in 1995 by beacon press\\ncarsons biographer linda j lear writes that carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly the writer as well as the woman she found this in freeman the two women had several common interests nature chief among them and began exchanging letters regularly while apart they would share summers for the remainder of carsons life and meet whenever else their schedules permitted\\nin regard to the extent of their relationship commentators have said that the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands freeman shared parts of carsons letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded some believe freeman and carsons relationship was romantic in nature one of the letters from carson to freeman reads but oh darling i want to be with you so terribly that it hurts while in another freeman writes i love you beyond expression my love is boundless as the sea carsons last letter to freeman before her death ends with never forget dear one how deeply i have loved you all these years\\nshortly before carsons death she and freeman destroyed hundreds of letters the surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as always rachel the letters of rachel carson and dorothy freeman 19521964 an intimate portrait of a remarkable friendship edited by martha freeman dorothys granddaughter who wrote at publication a few comments in early letters indicate that rachel and dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence i believe this caution prompted their destruction of some letters within the first two years of their friendship according to one reviewer the pair fit carolyn heilbruns characterization of a strong female friendship where what matters is not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual lovers or not but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere\\naccording to her biographer linda lear there was some disagreement about the funeral arrangements for rachel her brother robert carson insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in maryland this was against her wishes to be buried in maine in the end a compromise was reached carsons wishes were carried out by an organizing committee including her agent marie rodell her editor paul brooks and dorothy freeman in the spring of 1964 dorothy received half of rachels ashes in the mail sent to her by robert carson in the summer of that year dorothy carried out rachels final wishes scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of sheepscot bay in maine\\nthe edge of the sea and transition to conservation work\\nearly in 1953 carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the atlantic shore in 1955 she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy the edge of the sea which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems particularly along the eastern seaboard it appeared in the new yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its october 26 book release by houghton mifflin again a new publisher by this time carsons reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established the edge of the sea received highly favorable reviews if not quite as enthusiastic as for the sea around us\\nthrough 1955 and 1956 carson worked on several projectsincluding the script for an omnibus episode something about the skyand wrote articles for popular magazines her plan for the next book was to address evolution however the publication of julian huxleys evolution in actionand her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topicled her to abandon the project instead her interests were turning to conservation she considered an environmentthemed book project tentatively titled remembrance of the earth and became involved with the nature conservancy and other conservation groups she also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in maine she and freeman called the lost woods\\nin early 1957 a family tragedy struck for the third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31 leaving her 5yearold son roger christie an orphan carson took on the responsibility for roger when she adopted him along with caring for her aging mother carson moved to silver spring maryland to care for roger and spent much of 1957 putting together a new living situation and studying specific environmental threats\\nby late 1957 carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying the united states department of agriculture usda planned to eradicate fire ants other spraying programs involving chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates were on the rise for the rest of her life carsons main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse\\nsilent spring\\nsilent spring carsons bestknown book was published by houghton mifflin on september 27 1962 the book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment and is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement carson was not the first or the only person to raise concerns about ddt but her combination of scientific knowledge and poetic writing reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to ddt use in 1994 an edition of silent spring was published with an introduction written by vice president al gore in 2012 silent spring was designated a national historic chemical landmark by the american chemical society for its role in the development of the modern environmental movement\\nresearch and writing\\nstarting in the mid1940s carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since world war ii however the united states federal governments 1957 gypsy moth eradication program prompted carson to devote her research and her next book to pesticides and environmental poisons the gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of ddt and other pesticides mixed with fuel oil including the spraying of private land landowners on long island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped and many in affected regions followed the case closely though the suit was lost the supreme court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions\\nthe audubon naturalist society also actively opposed such spraying programs and recruited carson to help make public the governments exact spraying practices and the related research carson began the fouryear project of what would become silent spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to ddt she also attempted to enlist others to join the cause such as essayist e b white and several journalists and scientists by 1958 carson had arranged a book deal with plans to cowrite with newsweek science journalist edwin diamond however when the new yorker commissioned a long and wellpaid article on the topic from carson she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned soon it was a solo project diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of silent spring\\nas her research progressed carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides she also took advantage of her connections with many government scientists who supplied her with confidential information from reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control\\nshe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of biodynamic agriculture organic market gardeners their adviser dr ehrenfried pfeiffer other contacts and their suite of legal actions 19571960 against the us government according to recent research by paull 2013 this may have been the primary and for strategic reasons uncredited source for carsons book marjorie spock and mary t richards of long island new york contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt they compiled their evidence and shared it with carson who used it their extensive contacts and the trial transcripts as a primary input for silent spring carson wrote of the content as a gold mine of information and says i feel guilty about the mass of your material i have here and makes multiple references to pfeiffer and his correspondence\\nby 1959 the usdas agricultural research service responded to the criticism by carson and others with a public service film fire ant on trial carson characterized it as flagrant propaganda that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides especially dieldrin and heptachlor posed to humans and wildlife that spring carson wrote a letter published in the washington post that attributed the recent decline in bird populationsin her words the silencing of birdsto pesticide overuse that was also the year of the great cranberry scandal the 1957 1958 and 1959 crops of us cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole which caused cancer in laboratory rats and the sale of all cranberry products was halted carson attended the subsequent fda hearings on revising pesticide regulations she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying she also wondered about the possible financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs\\nresearch at the library of medicine of the national institutes of health brought carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancercausing chemicals of particular significance was the work of national cancer institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director wilhelm hueper who classified many pesticides as carcinogens carson and her research assistant jeanne davis with the help of nih librarian dorothy algire found evidence to support the pesticidecancer connection to carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clearcut though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis\\nby 1960 carson had more than enough research material and the writing was progressing rapidly in addition to the thorough literature search she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted however in january a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks greatly delaying the completion of silent spring as she was nearing full recovery in march just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book she discovered cysts in her left breast one of which necessitated a mastectomy though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment by december carson discovered that the tumor was malignant and the cancer had metastasized her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of the sea around us and by a collaborative photo essay with erich hartmann most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960 except for the discussion of recent research on biological pest controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides however further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962 while writing the book carson chose to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies could not use it against her she worried that if the companies knew they would use it as ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased\\nfinding a title for the book proved difficult silent spring was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds by august 1961 carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent marie rodell silent spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire book suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world rather than a single chapter title about the literal absence of birdsong with carsons approval editor paul brooks at houghton mifflin arranged for illustrations by louis and lois darling who also designed the cover the final writing was the first chapter a fable for tomorrow which carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic by mid1962 brooks and carson had essentially finished the editing and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions\\ncontent\\nas biographer mark hamilton lytle writes carson quite selfconsciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined postwar american culture the overriding theme of silent spring is the powerfuland often adverseeffect humans have on the natural world\\ncarsons main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment they are more properly termed biocides she argues because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests ddt is a prime example but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny many of which are subject to bioaccumulation carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically most of the book is devoted to pesticides effects on natural ecosystems however four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning cancer and other illnesses attributed to pesticides about ddt and cancer the subject of so much subsequent debate carson says only a little\\ncarson predicted increased consequences in the future especially as targeted pests develop pesticide resistance at the same time weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species the book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides\\nin regards to the pesticide ddt carson never actually called for an outright ban part of the argument she made in silent spring was that even if ddt and other insecticides had no environmental side effects their indiscriminate overuse was counterproductive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticides making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations\\ncarson further noted that malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes and emphasized the advice given by the director of hollands plant protection service practical advice should be spray as little as you possibly can rather than spray to the limit of your capacity  pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible\\npromotion and reception\\ncarson and the others involved with the publication of silent spring expected fierce criticism they were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics in preparation for the anticipated attacks carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the books release\\nmost of the books scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise among whom carson found strong support carson attended the white house conference on conservation in may 1962 houghton mifflin distributed proof copies of silent spring to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming new yorker serialization among many others carson also sent a proof copy to supreme court associate justice william o douglas a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the courts rejection of the long island pesticide spraying case and who had provided carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides\\nthough silent spring had generated a relatively high level of interest based on prepublication promotion this became much more intense with the serialization in the new yorker which began on june 16 1962 issue this brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists and a wide swath of the american populace around that time carson also learned that silent spring had been selected as the book of the month for october as she put it this would carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that dont know what a bookstore looks likemuch less the new yorker other publicity included a positive editorial in the new york times and excerpts of the serialized version in audubon magazine with another round of publicity in july and august as chemical companies responded the story of the birth defectcausing drug thalidomide broke just before the books publication as well inviting comparisons between carson and frances oldham kelsey the food and drug administration reviewer who had blocked the drugs sale in the united states\\nin the weeks leading up to the september 27 1962 publication there was strong opposition to silent spring from the chemical industry dupont a main manufacturer of ddt and 24d and velsicol chemical corporation exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor were among the first to respond dupont compiled an extensive report on the books press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion velsicol threatened legal action against houghton mifflin and the new yorker and audubon unless the planned silent spring features were canceled chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of nonspecific complaints some anonymously chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use however carsons and the publishers lawyers were confident in the vetting process silent spring had undergone the magazine and book publications proceeded as planned as did the large bookofthemonth printing which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by william o douglas\\namerican cyanamid biochemist robert whitestevens and former cyanamid chemist thomas jukes were among the most aggressive critics especially of carsons analysis of ddt according to whitestevens if man were to follow the teachings of miss carson we would return to the dark ages and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth others went further attacking carsons scientific credentials because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry and her character whitestevens labeled her a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature while former us secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson in a letter to former president dwight d eisenhower reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive she was probably a communist\\nmany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides however carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals impact on the entire ecosystem in fact she concludes her section on ddt in silent spring not by urging a total ban but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance\\nthe academic community including prominent defenders such as h j muller loren eiseley clarence cottam and frank egler by and large backed the books scientific claims public opinion soon turned carsons way as well the chemical industry campaign backfired as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers as well as silent spring book sales pesticide use became a major public issue especially after the cbs reports tv special the silent spring of rachel carson that aired april 3 1963 the program included segments of carson reading from silent spring and interviews with several other experts mostly critics including whitestevens according to biographer linda lear in juxtaposition to the wildeyed loudvoiced dr robert whitestevens in white lab coat carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the presidents science advisory committee within a year or so of publication the attacks on the book and carson had largely lost momentum\\nin one of her last public appearances carson testified before president john f kennedys science advisory committee the committee issued its report on may 15 1963 largely backing carsons scientific claims following the reports release she also testified before a united states senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations though carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations she could not accept the great majority of them her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy with only brief periods of remission she spoke as much as she was physically able however including a notable appearance on the today show and speeches at several dinners held in her honor in late 1963 she received a flurry of awards and honors the audubon medal from the national audubon society the cullum geographical medal from the american geographical society and induction into the american academy of arts and letters\\ndeath\\nweakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen carson became ill with a respiratory virus in january 1964 her condition worsened and in february doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments and in march they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver she died of a heart attack on april 14 1964 in her home in silver spring maryland\\nher body was cremated and the ashes buried beside her mother at parklawn memorial gardens rockville maryland some of her ashes were later scattered along the coast of southport island near sheepscot bay maine\\nlegacy\\ncollected papers and posthumous publications\\ncarson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to yale university to take advantage of the new stateoftheart preservations facilities of the beinecke rare book amp manuscript library her longtime agent and literary executor marie rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging carsons papers and correspondence distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive\\nin 1965 rodell arranged for the publication of an essay carson had intended to expand into a book the sense of wonder the essay which was combined with photographs by charles pratt and others exhorts parents to help their children experience the lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world  available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth sea and sky and their amazing life\\nin addition to the letters in always rachel in 1998 a volume of carsons previously unpublished work was published as lost woods the discovered writing of rachel carson edited by linda lear all of carsons books remain in print\\ngrassroots environmentalism and the epa\\ncarsons work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement silent spring in particular was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s according to environmental engineer and carson scholar h patricia hynes silent spring altered the balance of power in the world no one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically carsons work and the activism it inspired are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s it was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists\\nwhile there remains no evidence that carson was openly a womens rights activist her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement attacks on carsons credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an amateur it was said that her writing was too emotional ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint carson as hysterical but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agribusiness corporations others such as yaakov garb suggest that in addition to not being a womens rights activist carson also had no anticapitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted additionally the way photos of carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist but instead of her leisure activities\\ncarsons most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban ddt in the united states and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world though environmental concerns about ddt had been considered by government agencies as early as carsons testimony before the presidents science advisory committee the 1967 formation of the environmental defense fund was the first significant milestone in the campaign against ddt the organization brought lawsuits against the government to establish a citizens right to a clean environment and the arguments employed against ddt largely mirrored carsons by 1972 the environmental defense fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phaseout of ddt use in the united states except in emergency cases\\nthe creation of the environmental protection agency epa by the nixon administration in 1970 addressed another concern that carson had brought to light until then the same agency the usda was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry carson saw this as a conflict of interest since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy fifteen years after its creation one journalist described the epa as the extended shadow of silent spring much of the agencys early work such as enforcing the 1972 federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act was directly related to carsons work\\nin the 1980s the policies of the reagan administration emphasized economic growth rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to carson and her work\\nposthumous honors\\nvarious groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated carsons life and work since her death perhaps most significantly on june 9 1980 carson was awarded the presidential medal of freedom the highest civilian honor in the united states a 17 great americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year several other countries have since issued carson postage as well in 1973 carson was inducted into the national womens hall of fame\\nthe university of california santa cruz named one of its colleges formerly known as college eight rachel carson college in 2016 rachel carson college is the first college at the university to bear a womans name\\nmunichs rachel carson center for environment and society was founded in 2009 an international interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences it was established as a joint initiative of munichs ludwigmaximiliansuniversitt and the deutsches museum with the support of the german federal ministry of education and research\\ncarsons birthplace and childhood home in springdale pennsylvania now known as the rachel carson homestead became a national register of historic places site and the nonprofit rachel carson homestead association was created in 1975 to manage it her home in colesville maryland where she wrote silent spring was named a national historic landmark in 1991 near pittsburgh a hiking trail called the rachel carson trail and maintained by the rachel carson trails conservancy was dedicated to carson in 1975 a pittsburgh bridge was also renamed in carsons honor as the rachel carson bridge the pennsylvania department of environmental protection state office building in harrisburg is named in her honor elementary schools in gaithersburg montgomery county maryland sammamish washington and san jose california were named in her honor as were middle schools in beaverton oregon and herndon

considered portugals and the portuguese languages greatest poet his mastery of verse has been compared to that of shakespeare vondel homer virgil and dante he wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work os lusadas the lusiads his collection of poetry the parnasum of lus de cames was lost during his life the influence of his masterpiece os lusadas is so profound that portuguese is sometimes called the language of cames\\nthe day of his death 10 june os is portugals national day\\nlife\\norigins and youth\\nmuch of the information about lus de cames biography raises doubts and probably much of what circulates about him is nothing more than the typical folklore that is formed around a famous figure only a few dates are documented that guide its trajectory the ancestral home of the cames family had its origins in the kingdom of galicia not far from cape finisterre on his paternal side lus de cames was descended from vasco pires de cames galician troubadour warrior and fidalgo who moved to portugal in 1370 and received great benefits from the king in positions honours and lands and whose poetry of a nationalist nature contributed to ward off breton and italian influence and to shape a national troubadour style his son anto vaz de cames served in the red sea and married dona guiomar da gama related to vasco da gama from this marriage were born simo vaz de cames who served in the royal navy and did trade in guinea and india and another brother bento who followed the career of a man of letters and entered the priesthood joining the austin friars at the monastery of santa cruz which was a prestigious school for many young portuguese gentlemen simo married dona ana de s e macedo also from a noble family from santarm her only son lus vaz de cames according to jayne fernandes and some other authors was born in lisbon in 1524 three years later the city is being threatened by the plague the family moved following the court to coimbra however other cities claim the honour of being his birthplace coimbra santarm and alenquer although the first biographers of cames severin de faria and manoel correa initially gave his year of birth as 1517 records of the lists of the casa da ndia later consulted by manuel de faria e sousa seem to establish that cames was actually born in lisbon in 1524 the arguments for placing his birth outside of lisbon are weak but neither is it completely beyond doubt so the most recent scholarship considers his place and date of birth uncertain\\nabout his childhood much remains unknown at twelve or thirteen he would have been protected and educated by his uncle bento who sent him to coimbra to study tradition says that he was an undisciplined student but eager for knowledge interested in history cosmography and classic and modern literature however his name does not appear in the records of the university of coimbra but it is certain from his elaborate style and the profusion of erudite quotes that appear in his works that in some way he received a solid education it is possible that his uncle himself a chancellor of the university and the prior of the monastery of santa cruz instructed him or that he studied at the monastery college at about twenty years of age he probably moved to lisbon before completing his studies his family was poor but being noble he could be admitted to the court of john iii where he established fruitful intellectual contacts and began his career as a poet\\nit was suggested that he earned his living as a preceptor of francisco son of the count of linhares d antnio de noronha but this now seems hardly plausible it is also said that he adopted a bohemian lifestyle frequenting taverns and getting involved in tumultuous love affairs several ladies are cited by name in late biographies of the poet as having been the object of his affection but those identifications are currently considered apocryphal additions to his legend among them for example there was talk of a passion for infanta dona maria sister of the king but that audacity would have earned him time in prison another was catarina de atade with whom he allegedly had a frustrated love affair that resulted in his selfexile first in ribatejo and then by enlisting as a soldier in ceuta the reason for the latter trip is doubtful but the trip itself is accepted fact he remained there two years and lost his right eye in a naval battle in the strait of gibraltar back in lisbon he wasted no time in resuming his bohemian life\\na document dating from 1550 states that he had enlisted to travel to india lus de cames son of simo vaz and ana de s living in lisbon at mouraria squire 25 years old ginger bearded brought his father as guarantor goes on the ship of s pedro dos burgaleses  among the menatarms as it turns out he didnt board immediately in a corpus christi procession he got into an altercation with a certain gonalo borges employee of the royal palace and wounded him with a sword sentenced to prison he later received a letter of pardon and was released by royal order on march 7 1553 which says he is a young man and poor and he is going to serve in india this year manuel de faria e sousa found in the registers of the armada of india for that year 1553 under the title gente de guerra men of war the following statement fernando casado son of manuel casado and branca queimada residents of lisbon squire lus de cames son of simo vaz and ana de s squire took his place and he received 2400 like the others\\ncames set sail on palm sunday the 24th of march 1553 his last words he says in a letter were those of scipio africanus ingrata patria non possidebis ossa mea ungrateful fatherland you will not possess my bones\\njourney to the east\\nhe traveled aboard the carrack so bento belonging to the fleet of ferno lvares cabral which left the tagus on march 24 1553 during the trip he passed through the regions where vasco da gama had sailed faced a storm in the cape of good hope cabo da boa esperana where the three other ships in the fleet were lost and landed in goa in 1554 soon he enlisted in the service of the viceroy d afonso de noronha and fought in the expedition against the king of chemb or da pimenta in 1555 noronhas successor d pedro mascarenhas ordered manuel de vasconcelos to fight the moors in the red sea cames accompanied him but the squadron did not find the enemy and went to winter in ormuz in the persian gulf\\nprobably at this time he had already started writing os lusadas when he returned to goa in 1556 he met d francisco barreto in the government and composed for him the auto de filodemo which suggests that barreto looked upon cames with favor the early biographers however differ about cames relations with that ruler at the same time an anonymous satire criticizing the prevalence of immorality and corruption which was attributed to cames also was published since satires were condemned by the ordinances of king manuel cames would have been arrested for that but it has also been hypothesized that the arrest was actually for debts that cames had incurred it is possible that he remained in prison until 1561 and that he may have been convicted of additional offenses before then at any rate when d francisco coutinho assumed the governship of india cames was released and came under that mans employ and protection he was appointed to the position of superintendent for the dead and missing for macau in 1562 serving de facto from 1563 until 1564 or 1565 at that time macau was a trading post still in formation and almost uninhabited tradition says that there he wrote part of os lusadas in a cave which later was named after him\\non the trip back to goa he was shipwrecked as tradition says near the mouth of the mekong river managing to save only himself and the manuscript of os lusadas an event that inspired the famous redondilha sobre os rios que vo considered by antnio srgio the backbone of the camonian lyric as is repeatedly cited in the critical literature the trauma of the shipwreck in the words of leal de matos had the most profound impact on redefining the themes of os lusadas this being noticeable beginning with canto vii a fact already noted by diogo do couto a friend of the poet who partly accompanied the work as it was being written\\nhis rescue took months to occur and there is no record of how it happened but he was taken to malacca where he received a new arrest warrant for misappropriating the assets of the dead that had been entrusted to him the exact date of his return to goa is not known but he may have remained in prison there for some time couto says that in the shipwreck dinamene a chinese maiden with whom cames had fallen in love died but ribeiro and others reject that story the next viceroy d anto de noronha was a longtime friend of cames having first met him during his morocco adventure certain biographers claim that he was promised a position at the trading post at chaul but he did not take up the position severim de faria said that the final years spent in goa were occupied with poetry and military activities where he always showed bravery readiness and loyalty to the crown\\nit is difficult to determine what his daily life in the east would have been like beyond what can be extrapolated from his military status it seems certain that he always lived modestly and may have shared a house with friends in one of those collective dwellings where it was customary for people from the homeland to associate as ramalho notes some of these friends must have been in possession of a certain degree of culture and would have provided illustrious companionship ribeiro saraiva and moura admit that he may have encountered among other figures ferno mendes pinto ferno vaz dourado ferno lvares do oriente garcia de orta and the aforementioned diogo do couto creating opportunities for debating literary topics and the like he may also have attended lectures at one of goas colleges or religious establishments ribeiro adds that\\nthese fellows who lived in goa far from their homeland and family between campaigns against the turk which took place in the summer and many of them having little to do in winter in addition to the aforementioned lectures and constant readings including many of the classics ovid horace virgil enjoying the company of women and musical gatherings living among themselves without regard to social distinctions their main objective was to have fun as much as possible even when writing poetry thus their predilection for satire which had a strongly negative social impact and exposed them to imprisonment per the manueline ordinances title lxxix and therefore carried an edge of adventure and risk an example of this is the tournament satire a mockery that is mentioned by faria e sousa and about which unlike os disbarates da ndia there is no scholarly contestation of its camonian authorship it may in fact be the reason for one of cames arrests\\nat such meetings the participants were both menatarms and men of letters and were in search not only of military success and material fortune but also of the fame and glory born of culture this was one of the great aspirations of the humanism of that era and from it may have sprung the idea of creating an academy reproducing within the limitations of the local context the model of renaissance academies such as the one founded in florence by marsilio ficino and his circle where neoplatonic ideals were cultivated\\nreturn to portugal\\nwhether it was by invitation or simply a matter of taking the chance to bridge part of the distance that separated him from his homeland it is not known for certain but in december 1567 cames embarked on pedro barretos ship to sofala on the island of mozambique where barreto had been appointed governor and there cames would wait for transport to lisbon at a future date the early biographers say that pedro barreto was treacherous making false promises to cames so that after two years diogo do couto found him in a precarious state\\nin mozambique we found that prince of poets of his day my companion and friend lus de cames so poor that he was dependent on friends to feed him upon embarking for the kingdom we gathered all the clothing that he needed and there was no shortage of people who gave him to eat and that winter that he was in mozambique having just finished his lusadas in preparation for printing he had been writing a great deal in another book which he entitled the parnassus of lus de cames it being a book of great erudition doctrine and philosophy but which was stolen from him\\nwhile attempting to set sail with couto cames found his departure embargoed in the amount of two hundred cruzados by barreto demanding reimbursement for monies spent on the poets behalf his friends however collected the amount and cames was released arriving in cascais aboard the carrack santa clara on april 7 1570\\nafter so many adventures he finally completed os lusadas presenting them in recitation to sebastian the king still a teenager ordered the work to be published in 1572 also granting a small pension to lus de cames noble knight of my house in payment for services rendered in india the value of the pension did not exceed fifteen thousand ris a year which if not generous was also not as miserly as has been suggested considering that the royal palaces bridesmaids received around ten thousand ris for a veteran soldier the sum must have been considered sufficient and honorable at the time but the pension wouldve only lasted for three years and although the grant was renewable it seems that it was paid irregularly causing the poet to experience material difficulties\\ncames lived out his final years in a room in a house near the convent of santa ana in a state according to tradition of the most unworthy poverty without a rag to cover him le gentil considered this view a romantic exaggeration as he was still able keep a slave named jau whom he had brought with him from the east and official documents attest that he had some means of livelihood after being embittered by the portuguese defeat at the battle of alccer quibir in which sebastian disappeared leading portugal to lose its independence to the spanish crown he was stricken by bubonic plague according to le gentil he was transported to a hospital and died on june 10 1580 being buried according to faria e sousa in a shallow grave in the convent of santa ana or in the cemetery of the poor in the same hospital according to tefilo braga his mother having survived him began to receive his pension as an inheritance the receipts found at torre do tombo the portuguese national archive document the date of the poets death although an epitaph written by d gonalo coutinho has been preserved which mistakenly assigns his death to the year 1579 after the 1755 earthquake which destroyed most of lisbon attempts were made to find the remains of cames but to no avail the bones deposited in 1880 in a tomb in the jernimos monastery are in all probability someone elses\\nappearance character loves and iconography\\nthe testimonies of his contemporaries describe him as a man of average size with reddish blond hair blind in his right eye skilled in all physical exercises and with a temperamental disposition having little difficulty in engaging in fights it is said that he had great value as a soldier exhibiting courage combativeness a sense of honor and willingness to serve a good companion in his spare time liberal cheerful and witty when the blows of fortune did not overwhelm his spirit and saddened him he was aware of his merit as a man as a soldier and as a poet\\nall efforts made to discover the definitive identity of his muse were in vain and several contradictory proposals were made about alleged women present in his life cames himself suggested in one of his poems that there were several muses to inspire him when he said in various flames it was often burning names of supposed ladies like their loved ones appear only primitively in his poems and can therefore be ideal figures no mention of any ladies identifiable by name is given in the poets first biographies those of pedro de mariz and that of severim de faria who only collected rumors about some loves in pao da rainha reference to catarina de atade only appeared in the edition of rimas de faria e sousa in the middle of the 17th century and to infanta on jos maria rodrigues which was only published in the early 20th century the decanted dinamene also appears to be a poetic image rather than a real person ribeiro proposed several alternatives to explain it the name might have been a cryptonym of dona joana meneses dina  dioana  mene one of his possible loves who died on the way to the indies and was buried in the sea daughter of violante countess of linhares whom he would also have loved in portugal and pointed out the occurrence of the name dinamene in poems written probably around the arrival in india before proceeding to china where it is said that he would have found the girl he also referred to the opinion of researchers who claim the mention of couto the only primitive reference to the chinese outside of the camonian work itself to have been falsified being introduced a posteriori with the possibility that it is even a spelling error a corruption of dignamente worthily in the final version of coutos manuscript the name would not even have been cited even though proving it is difficult with the disappearance of the manuscript\\nprobably executed between 1573 and 1575 the socalled portrait painted in red illustrated at the opening of the article is considered by vasco graa moura as the only and precious reliable document we have to know the features of the epic portrayed in life by a professional painter  what is known of this portrait is a copy made at the request of the 3rd duke of lafes executed by lus jos pereira de resende between 1819 and 1844 from the original that was found in a green silk bag in the rubble of the fire at the palace of the counts of ericeira which has since disappeared it is a very faithful copy that\\ndue to the restricted dimensions of the drawing the texture of the blood creating spots of distribution of values the rigor of the contours and the definition of the contrasted planes the reticulated neutral that harmonizes the background and highlights the bust of the portrait the type of the wrap around limits from which the enlightening signature runs down in short the symbolic apparatus of the image captured in the pose of a graphic book illustration was intended for the opening of an engraving on a copper plate to illustrate one of the first editions of the lusiads\\nalso survived a miniature painted in india in 1581 by order of ferno teles de meneses and offered to the viceroy d lus de atade who according to testimonies of the time was very similar to his appearance another portrait was found in the 1970s by maria antonieta de azevedo dated 1556 and showing the poet in prison the first medal with its effigy appeared in 1782 ordered to mint by the baron of dillon in england where cames is crowned with laurels and dressed in coat of arms with the inscription apollo portuguez  honor de hespanha  nasceo 1524  morreo 1579 in 1793 a reproduction of this medal was coined in portugal by order of toms jos de aquino librarian of the real mesa censria\\nover the centuries the image of cames was represented numerous times in engraving painting and sculpture by portuguese and foreign artists and several monuments were erected in his honor notably the great monument to cames installed in 1867 in praa de lus de cames in lisbon by victor bastos which is the center of official public ceremonies and popular demonstrations he was also honored in musical compositions appeared with his effigy on medals currency notes stamps and coins and as a character in novels poetry and plays the film cames directed by jos leito de barros was the first portuguese film to participate in the cannes film festival in 1946 among the famous artists who took him as a model for his works are bordalo pinheiro jos simes de almeida francisco augusto metrass antnio soares dos reis horace vernet jos malhoa vieira portuense domingos sequeira and lagoa henriques a crater on the planet mercury and an asteroid in the main belt were named after him\\nwork\\ncontext\\ncames lived in the final phase of the european renaissance a period marked by many changes in culture and society which mark the end of the middle ages and the beginning of the modern age and the transition from feudalism to capitalism it was called renaissance due to the rediscovery and revaluation of the cultural references of classical antiquity which guided the changes of this period towards a humanist and naturalist ideal that affirmed the dignity of man placing him at the center of the universe making him the researcher par excellence of nature and privileging reason and science as arbitrators of manifest life during this period several scientific instruments were invented and several natural laws and physical entities previously unknown were discovered the knowledge of the face of the planet itself changed after the discoveries of the great navigations the spirit of intellectual speculation and scientific research was on the rise causing physics mathematics medicine astronomy philosophy engineering philology and several other branches of knowledge to reach a level of complexity efficiency and accuracy unprecedented which led to an optimistic conception of human history as a continuous expansion and always for the better in a way the renaissance was an original and eclectic attempt to harmonize pagan neoplatonism with the christian religion eros with charitas together with oriental jewish and arab influences and where the study of magic astrology and the occult was not absent it was also the time when strong national states began to be created commerce and cities expanded and the bourgeoisie became a force of great social and economic importance contrasting with the relative decline in the influence of religion in world affairs\\nin the 16th century the time in which cames lived the influence of the italian renaissance expanded throughout europe however several of its most typical features were declining in particular because of a series of political disputes and wars that altered the european political map with italy losing its place as a power and the split of catholicism with the emergence of the protestant reformation in the catholic reaction counterreformation was launched the inquisition was reactivated and ecclesiastical censorship was rekindled at the same time machiavellis doctrines became widespread dissociating ethics from the practice of power the result was the reaffirmation of the power of religion over the profane world and the formation of an agitated spiritual political social and intellectual atmosphere with strong doses of pessimism reverberating unfavorably on the former freedom that artists enjoyed despite this the intellectual and artistic acquisitions of the high renaissance that were still fresh and shining before the eyes could not be forgotten immediately even if their philosophical substrate could no longer remain valid in the face of new political religious and social facts the new art that was made although inspired by the source of classicism translated it into restless anxious distorted ambivalent forms attached to intellectualist preciosities characteristics that reflected the dilemmas of the century and define the general style of this phase as mannerist\\nsince the middle of the 15th century portugal had established itself as a great naval and commercial power its arts were developing and enthusiasm for maritime conquests was boiling the reign of d joo ii was marked by the formation of a feeling of national pride and in the time of d manuel i as spina amp bechara say pride had given way to delirium to the pure euphoria of world domination at the beginning of the 16th century garcia de resende lamented that there was no one who could celebrate so many feats worthily claiming that there was epic material superior to that of the romans and trojans filling this gap joo de barros wrote his cavalry novel a crnica do imperador clarimundo 1520 in epic format shortly thereafter antnio ferreira appeared establishing himself as a mentor of the classicist generation and challenging his contemporaries to sing the glories of portugal in high style when cames appeared the land was prepared for the apotheosis of the homeland a homeland that had fought hard to conquer its sovereignty first of the moors and after castile had developed an adventurous spirit that had taken it across the oceans expanding the known borders of the world and opening new routes of trade and exploration defeating enemy armies and the hostile forces of nature but at this point however the political and cultural crisis was already being announced materializing shortly after his death when the country lost its sovereignty to spain\\noverview\\ncames production is divided into three genres lyrical epic and theatrical his lyrical work was immediately appreciated as a high achievement he demonstrated his virtuosity especially in cantos and elegies but his redondilhas are not far behind in fact he was a master in this form giving new life to the art of gloss instilling in it spontaneity and simplicity a delicate irony and a lively phrasing taking courtesan poetry to its highest level and showing that he also knew how to express perfectly joy and relaxation his epic production is synthesized in os lusadas an intense glorification of portuguese feats not only of his military victories but also the conquest over elements and physical space with recurring use of classic allegories the idea of a national epic has existed in the portuguese heart since the 15th century when the navigations started but it was up to cames in the following century to materialize it in his dramatic works he sought to fuse nationalist and classic elements\\nprobably if he had remained in portugal as a courtly poet he would never have achieved the mastery of his art the experiences he accumulated as a soldier and navigator enriched his worldview and excited his talent through them he managed to free himself from the formal limitations of courtesan poetry and the difficulties he went through the profound anguish of exile the longing for his country indelibly impregnated his spirit and communicated with his work and from there influenced in a marked way subsequent generations of portuguese writers his best poems shine exactly for what is genuine in the suffering expressed and the honesty of that expression and this is one of the main reasons that put his poetry at such a high level\\nits sources were numerous he dominated latin and spanish and demonstrated a solid knowledge of grecoroman mythology ancient and modern european history portuguese chroniclers and classical literature with authors such as ovid xenophon lucan valerius flaccus horace standing out but especially homer and virgil from whom he borrowed various structural and stylistic elements and sometimes even passages in almost literal transcription according to his quotations he also seems to have had a good knowledge of works by ptolemy diogenes lartius pliny the elder strabo and pomponius mela among other historians and ancient scientists among the moderns he was aware of the italian production of francesco petrarca ludovico ariosto torquato tasso giovanni boccaccio and jacopo sannazaro and of castilian literature\\nfor those who consider the renaissance to be a homogeneous historical period informed by classical ideals and extending to the end of the 16th century cames is quite simply a renaissance but in general it is recognized that the 16th century was largely dominated by a stylistic derivation called mannerism which at various points is an anticlassical school and in many ways prefigures the baroque thus for many authors it is more appropriate to describe the camonian style as mannerist distinguishing it from typical renaissance classicism this is justified by the presence of several language resources and an approach to its themes that are not in agreement with the doctrines of balance economy tranquility harmony unity and invariable idealism which are the fundamental axes of renaissance classicism cames after a typically classic initial phase moved on to other paths and anxiety and drama became his companions throughout the lusiads the signs of a political and spiritual crisis are visible the prospect of the decline of the empire and the character of the portuguese remains in the air censored by bad customs and the lack of appreciation for the arts alternating with excerpts in which its enthusiastic apology they are also typical of mannerism and would become even more baroque the taste for contrast for emotional flare for conflict for paradox for religious propaganda for the use of complex figures of speech and preciousness even for the grotesque and monstrous many of them common features in camonian work\\nthe mannerist nature of his work is also marked by the ambiguities generated by the rupture with the past and by the concomitant adherence to it the first manifested in the visualization of a new era and in the use of new poetic formulas from italy and the second in the use of archaisms typical of the middle ages along with the use of formal renaissance and classicist models he cultivated the medieval genres of vilancete cantiga and trova for joaquim dos santos the contradictory character of his poetry is found in the contrast between two opposing premises idealism and practical experience he combined typical values of humanist rationalism with other derivatives of cavalry crusades and feudalism aligned the constant propaganda of the catholic faith with ancient mythology responsible in the aesthetic plan for all the action that materializes the final realization discarding the mediocre aurea dear to classics to advocate the primacy of the exercise of weapons and the glorious conquest\\nos lusadas\\nos lusadas or the lusiads is considered the portuguese epic par excellence the title itself already suggests its nationalist intentions being derived from the ancient roman denomination of portugal lusitania it is one of the most important epics of the modern age due to its greatness and universality the epic tells the story of vasco da gama and the portuguese heroes who sailed around the cape of good hope and opened a new route to india it is a humanist epic even in its contradictions in the association of pagan mythology with the christian view in the opposite feelings about war and empire in the taste of rest and in the desire for adventure in the appreciation of sensual pleasure and in the demands of an ethical life in the perception of greatness and in the presentiment of decline in the heroism paid for with suffering and struggle the poem opens with the famous verses\\nthe ten cantos of the poem add up to 1102 stanzas in a total of 8816 decyllable verses using the ottava rima abababcc after an introduction an invocation and a dedication to king sebastian the action begins which merges myths and historical facts vasco da gama sailing along the coast of africa is observed by the assembly of classical gods who discuss the fate of the expedition which is protected by venus and attacked by bacchus resting for a few days in malindi at the request of the local king vasco da gama narrates all portuguese history from its origins to the journey they undertake the cantos iii iv and v contain some of the best passages of the entire epic the episode of ins de castro which becomes a symbol of love and death the battle of aljubarrota the vision of d manuel i the description of st elmos fire the story of the giant adamastor back on the ship the poet takes advantage of his free time to tell the story of the twelve of england while bacchus summons the sea gods to destroy the portuguese fleet venus intervenes and ships reach calicut india there paulo da gama receives the kings representatives and explains the meaning of the banners that adorn the flagship on the return trip the sailors enjoy the island created for them by venus rewarding the nymphs with their favors one of them sings the glorious future of portugal and the scene ends with a description of the universe by tethys and vasco da gama then the journey continues home\\nin os lusadas cames achieves a remarkable harmony between classical scholarship and practical experience developed with consummate technical skill describing portuguese adventures with moments of serious thought mixed with others of delicate sensitivity and humanism the great descriptions of the battles the manifestation of the natural forces the sensual encounters transcend the allegory and the classicist allusion that permeate all the work and present themselves as a fluent speech and always of a high aesthetic level not only for its narrative character especially well achieved but also by the superior mastery of all the resources of the language and the art of versification with a knowledge of a wide range of styles used in efficient combination the work is also a serious warning for christian kings to abandon small rivalries and unite against muslim expansion\\nthe structure of the work is in itself worthy of interest as according to jorge de sena nothing is arbitrary in os lusadas among the arguments he presented was the use of the golden section a defined relationship between the parts and the whole organizing the set in ideal proportions that emphasize especially significant passages sena demonstrated that when applying the golden section to the whole work it falls precisely on the verse that describes the arrival of the portuguese in india applying the separate section to the two resulting parts in the first part comes the episode that reports the death of ins de castro and in the second the stanza that narrates cupids efforts to unite the portuguese and the nymphs which for sena reinforces the importance of love throughout the composition two other elements give os lusadas its modernity and distance it from classicism the introduction of doubt contradiction and questioning in disagreement with the affirmative certainty that characterizes the classic epic and the primacy of rhetoric over action replacing the world of facts with that of words which do not fully recover reality and evolve into metalanguage with the same disruptive effect on the traditional epic\\naccording to costa pimpo there is no evidence that cames intended to write his epic before he traveled to india although heroic themes were already present in his previous production it is possible that he drew some inspiration from fragments of the decades of asia by joo de barros and the history of the discovery and conquest of india by the portuguese by ferno lopes de castanheda on classical mythology he was certainly well informed before that as well as on ancient epic literature apparently the poem started to take shape as early as 1554 storck considers that the determination to write it was born during the sea voyage itself between 1568 and 1569 he was seen in mozambique by the historian diogo do couto his friend still working on the work which only came to light in lisbon in 1572\\nthe success of the publication of os lusadas supposedly required a second edition in the same year as the princeps edition the two differ in countless details and it was debated at length which one would in fact be the original nor is it clear to whom the amendments to the second text are due currently the edition that shows the publishers brand a pelican with its neck turned to the left which is called edition a carried out under the supervision of the author is recognized as original however edition b was for a long time taken as princeps with disastrous consequences for the later critical analysis of the work apparently edition b was produced later around 1584 or 1585 in a clandestine manner taking the fictitious date of 1572 to bypass the delays of censorship of the time if it were published as a new edition and to correct the serious defects of another 1584 edition the socalled piscos edition however maria helena paiva raised the hypothesis that editions a and b are only variants of the same edition which was corrected after the typographic composition but while printing was already in progress according to the researcher the need to make the most of the press led to the conclusion that after printing a shape which consisted of several folios a first test was taken which was corrected while the press continued now with the corrected text there were therefore uncorrected printed folios and corrected printed folios which were grouped indistinctly in the same copy so that there were no two copies exactly the same in the press system of that time\\nrimas\\ncames lyric work dispersed in manuscripts was collected and published posthumously in 1595 under the title rimas rhymes throughout the 17th century the growing prestige of his epic contributed to raise the appreciation for these other poems even more the collection includes redondilhas odes glosses cantigas twists or variations sextilhas sonnets elegies eclogues and other small stanzas his lyrical poetry comes from several different sources the sonnets generally follow the italian style derived from petrarch the songs took the model of petrarch and pietro bembo in the odes the influence of the troubadour poetry of chivalry and classical poetry is verified but with a more refined style in the sextilhas the provenal influence is clear in the redondilhas it expanded the form deepened the lyricism and introduced a theme worked on antitheses and paradoxes unknown in the old tradition of cantigas de amigo and the elegies are quite classicist its resorts follow an epistolary style with moralizing themes eclogues are perfect pieces of the pastoral genre derived from virgil and the italians the influence of spanish poetry by garcilaso de la vega jorge de montemor juan boscn gregorio silvestre and several other names was also detected in many points of his lyric as his commentator faria e sousa pointed out\\ndespite the care of the first editor of rimas ferno rodrigues lobo soropita in the 1595 edition several apocryphal poems were included many poems were discovered over the next few centuries and attributed to him but not always with careful critical analysis the result was that for example while in the original rhymes there were 65 sonnets in the 1861 edition of juromenha there were 352 in the 1953 edition of aguiar e silva 166 pieces were still listed in addition many editions modernized or embellished the original text a practice that was particularly pronounced after the 1685 edition of faria e sousa giving rise to and rooting a tradition of its own in this adulterated lesson that caused enormous difficulties for critical study more scientific studies only began to be undertaken at the end of the 19th century with the contribution of wilhelm storck and carolina michalis de vasconcelos who discarded several apocryphal compositions at the beginning of the 20th century work continued with jos maria rodrigues and afonso lopes vieira who published rimas in 1932 in an edition they called crtica criticism although it did not deserve the name it adopted large parts of faria and sousas lesson but editors claimed to have used the original editions from 1595 and 1598 on the other hand they definitely raised the issue of textual fraud that had been perpetuating for a long time and had tampered with the poems to the point of becoming unrecognizable one example is enough\\nit seems impossible to reach a definitive result in this purge however enough authentic material survives to guarantee his position as the best portuguese lyricist and the greatest renaissance poet in portugal\\ncomedies\\nthe general content of his works for the stage combines in the same way as in os lusadas nationalism and classic inspiration his production in this field is limited to three works all in the genre of comedy and in the format of self elrei seleuco filodemo and anfitries the attribution of elrei seleuco to cames however is controversial its existence was not known until 1654 when it appeared published in the first part of rimas in the craesbeeck edition which gave no details about its origin and had little care in editing the text the play also differs in several aspects from the other two that survived such as its much shorter length an act the existence of a prologue in prose and the less profound and less erudite treatment of the love theme the theme of the complicated passion of antiochus son of king seleucus i nicator for his stepmother queen estratonice was taken from a historical fact from antiquity transmitted by plutarch and repeated by petrarch and the spanish popular songwriter working it in the style by gil vicente\\nanfitries published in 1587 is an adaptation of plautus amphitryon where it emphasizes the comic character of the amphitryon myth highlighting the omnipotence of love which subdues even the immortals also following the vincentian tradition the play was written in smaller redondilhas and uses bilingualism using castilian in the lines of the character ssia a slave to mark his low social level in passages that reach the grotesque a feature that appears in the other pieces as well filodemo composed in india and dedicated to the viceroy d francisco barreto is a comedy of morality in five acts according to the classical division being of the three the one that remained most alive in the interest of the critic due to the multiplicity of human experiences it describes and for the sharpness of psychological observation the theme is about the love of a servant filodemo for the daughter dionisa of the nobleman in the house of the one he serves with autobiographical traits cames saw comedy as a secondary genre of interest only as a diversion of circumstance but he achieved significant results by transferring the comicality of the characters to the action and refining the plot so he pointed out a path for the renewal of portuguese comedy however his suggestion was not followed by the growers of the genus who succeeded him\\nbibliography\\nworks by cames'}, {'title': 'Percy_Bysshe_Shelley', 'label': 'Writer', 'text': 'percy bysshe shelley   4 august 17928 july 1822 was one of

syon house academy of brentford middlesex where his cousin thomas medwin was a pupil shelley was bullied and unhappy at the school and sometimes responded with violent rage he also began suffering from the nightmares hallucinations and sleep walking that were to periodically afflict him throughout his life shelley developed an interest in science which supplemented his voracious reading of tales of mystery romance and the supernatural during his holidays at field place his sisters were often terrified at being subjected to his experiments with gunpowder acids and electricity back at school he blew up a paling fence with gunpowder\\nin 1804 shelley entered eton college a period which he later recalled with loathing he was subjected to particularly severe mob bullying which the perpetrators called shelleybaits a number of biographers and contemporaries have attributed the bullying to shelleys aloofness nonconformity and refusal to take part in fagging his peculiarities and violent rages earned him the nickname mad shelley his interest in the occult and science continued and contemporaries describe him giving an electric shock to a master blowing up a tree stump with gunpowder and attempting to raise spirits with occult rituals in his senior years shelley came under the influence of a parttime teacher dr james lind who encouraged his interest in the occult and introduced him to liberal and radical authors shelley also developed an interest in plato and idealist philosophy which he pursued in later years through selfstudy according to richard holmes shelley by his leaving year had gained a reputation as a classical scholar and a tolerated eccentric \\nin his last term at eton his first novel zastrozzi appeared and he had established a following among his

experiments in the laboratory he set up in his room he met a fellow student thomas jefferson hogg who became his closest friend shelley became increasingly politicised under hoggs influence developing strong radical and antichristian views such views were dangerous in the reactionary political climate prevailing during britains war with napoleonic france and shelleys father warned him against hoggs

with hogg and a poetical essay on the existing state of things shelley mailed the necessity of atheism to all the bishops and heads of colleges at oxford and he was called to appear before the colleges fellows including the dean george rowley his refusal to college authorities to answer questions regarding whether or not he authored the pamphlet resulted in his expulsion from oxford on 25march 1811 along with hogg hearing of his sons expulsion shelleys father threatened to cut all contact with shelley unless he agreed to return home and study under tutors appointed by him shelleys refusal to do so led to a fallingout with his father\\nmarriage to harriet westbrook\\nin late december 1810 shelley had met harriet westbrook a pupil at the same boarding school as shelleys sisters they corresponded frequently that winter and also after shelley had been expelled from oxford shelley expounded his radical ideas on politics religion and marriage to harriet and they gradually convinced each other that she was oppressed by her father and at school shelleys infatuation with harriet developed in the months following his expulsion when he was under severe emotional strain due

harriet and eliza soon left for keswick in the lake district leaving hogg in york\\nat this time shelley was also involved in an intense platonic relationship with elizabeth hitchener a 28yearold unmarried schoolteacher of advanced views with whom he had been corresponding hitchener whom shelley called the sister of my soul and my second self became his confidante and intellectual companion as he developed his views on politics religion ethics and personal relationships shelley proposed that she join him harriet and eliza in a communal household where all property would be shared\\nthe shelleys and eliza spent december and january in keswick where shelley visited robert southey whose poetry he admired southey was taken with shelley even though there was a wide gulf between them politically and predicted great things for him as a poet southey also informed shelley that william godwin author of political justice which had greatly influenced him in his youth and which shelley also admired was still alive shelley wrote to godwin offering himself as his devoted disciple godwin who had modified many of his earlier radical views advised shelley to reconcile with his father become a scholar before he published anything else and give up his avowed plans for political agitation in ireland\\nmeanwhile shelley had met his fathers patron charles howard 11th duke of norfolk who helped secure the reinstatement of shelleys allowance with harriets allowance also restored shelley now had the funds for his irish venture their departure for ireland was precipitated by increasing hostility towards the shelley household from their landlord and neighbours who were alarmed by shelleys scientific experiments pistol shooting and radical political views as tension mounted shelley claimed he had been attacked in his home by ruffians an event which might have been real or a delusional episode triggered by stress this was the first of a series of episodes in subsequent years where shelley claimed to have been attacked by strangers during periods of personal crisis\\nearly in 1812 shelley wrote published and personally distributed in dublin three political tracts an address to the irish people proposals for an association of philanthropists and declaration of rights he also delivered a speech at a meeting of oconnells catholic committee in which he called for catholic emancipation repeal of the act of union and an end to the oppression of the irish poor reports of shelleys subversive activities were sent to the home secretary\\nreturning from ireland the shelley household travelled to wales then devon where they again came under government surveillance for distributing subversive literature elizabeth hitchener joined the household in devon but several months later had a falling out with the shelleys and left\\nthe shelley household had settled in tremadoc wales in september 1812 where shelley worked on queen mab a utopian allegory with extensive notes preaching atheism free love republicanism and vegetarianism the poem was published the following year in a private edition of 250 copies although few were initially distributed because of the risk of prosecution for seditious and religious libel\\nin february 1813 shelley claimed he was attacked in his home at night the incident might have been real a hallucination brought on by stress or a hoax staged by shelley in order to escape government surveillance creditors and his entanglements in local politics the shelleys and eliza fled to ireland then london\\nback in england shelleys debts mounted as he tried unsuccessfully to reach a financial settlement with his father on 23 june harriet gave birth to a girl eliza ianthe shelley and in the following months the relationship between shelley and his wife deteriorated shelley resented the influence harriets sister had over her while harriet was alienated by shelleys close friendship with an attractive widow harriet boinville and her daughter cornelia turner following ianthes birth the shelleys moved frequently across london wales the lake district scotland and berkshire to escape creditors and search for a home\\nin march 1814 shelley remarried harriet in london to settle any doubts about the legality of their edinburgh wedding and secure the rights of their child nevertheless the shelleys lived apart

seeing him shelley and mary eloped to europe on 28 july taking marys stepsister claire clairmont with them before leaving shelley had secured a loan of 3000 but had left most of the funds at the disposal of godwin and harriet who was now pregnant the financial arrangement with godwin led to rumours that he had sold his daughters to shelley\\nshelley mary and claire made their way across warravaged france where shelley wrote to harriet asking her to meet them in switzerland with the money he had left for her hearing nothing from harriet in switzerland and unable to secure sufficient funds or suitable accommodation the three travelled to germany and holland before returning to england on 13 september\\nshelley spent the next few months trying to raise loans and avoid bailiffs mary

followed in early january by news that shelleys grandfather sir bysshe had died leaving an estate worth 220000 however the settlement of the estate and a financial settlement between shelley and his father now sir timothy wasnt concluded until april the following year \\nin february 1815 mary gave premature birth to a baby girl who died ten days later deepening her depression in the following weeks mary became close to hogg who temporarily moved into the household shelley was almost certainly having a sexual relationship with claire at this time and it is possible that mary with shelleys encouragement was also having a sexual relationship with hogg in may claire left the household at marys insistence to reside in lynmouth\\nin august shelley and mary moved to bishopsgate where shelley worked on alastor a long poem in blank verse based on the myth of narcissus and echo alastor was published in an edition of 250 in early 1816 to poor sales and largely unfavourable reviews from the

party arrived in geneva in may and rented a house close to villa diodati on the shores of lake geneva where byron was staying there shelley byron and the others engaged in discussions about literature science and various philosophical doctrines one night while byron was reciting coleridges christabel shelley suffered a severe panic attack with hallucinations the previous night mary had had a more productive vision or nightmare which inspired her novel frankenstein\\nshelley and byron then took a boating tour around lake geneva which inspired shelley to write his hymn to intellectual beauty his first substantial poem since alastor a tour of chamonix in the french alps inspired mont blanc which has been described as an atheistic response to coleridges hymn before sunrise in the vale of chamoni during this tour shelley often signed guest books with a declaration that he was an atheist these declarations were seen by other british tourists including southey which hardened attitudes against shelley back home\\nrelations between byron and shelleys party became strained when byron was told that claire was pregnant with his child shelley mary and claire left switzerland in late august with arrangements for the expected baby still unclear although shelley made provision for claire and the baby in his will in january 1817 claire gave birth to a daughter by byron who she named alba but later renamed allegra in accordance with byrons wishes\\nmarriage to mary godwin\\nshelley and mary returned to england in september 1816 and in early october they heard that marys halfsister fanny imlay had killed herself godwin believed that fanny had been in love with shelley and shelley himself suffered depression and guilt over her death writing friend had i known thy secret grief

been abandoned by her new lover in her suicide letter she asked shelley to take custody of their son charles but to leave their daughter in her sister elizas care\\nshelley married mary godwin on 30 december despite his philosophical objections to the institution the marriage was intended to help secure shelleys custody of his children by harriet and to placate godwin who had refused to see shelley and mary because of their previous adulterous relationship after a prolonged legal battle the court of chancery eventually awarded custody of shelley and harriets children to foster parents on the grounds that shelley had abandoned his first wife for mary without cause and was an atheist\\nin march 1817 the shelleys moved to the village of marlow buckinghamshire where shelleys friend thomas love peacock lived the shelley household included claire and her baby allegra both of whose presence was resented by mary shelleys generosity with money and increasing debts also led to financial and marital stress as did godwins frequent requests for financial help\\non 2 september mary gave birth to a daughter clara everina shelley soon after shelley left for london with claire which increased marys resentment towards her stepsister shelley was arrested for two days in london over money he owed and attorneys visited mary in marlowe over shelleys debts\\nshelley took part in the literary and political circle that surrounded leigh hunt and during this period he met william hazlitt and john keats shelleys major work during this time was laon and cythna a long narrative poem featuring incest and attacks on religion it was hastily withdrawn after publication due to fears of prosecution for religious libel and was reedited and reissued as the revolt of islam in january 1818 shelley also published two political tracts under a pseudonym a proposal for putting reform to the vote throughout the kingdom march 1817 and an address to the people on the death of princess charlotte november 1817 in december he wrote ozymandias which is considered to be one of his finest sonnets as part of a competition with friend and fellow poet horace smith\\nitaly\\non 12 march 1818 the shelleys and claire left england to escape its tyranny civil and religious a doctor had also recommended that shelley go to italy for his chronic lung complaint and shelley had arranged to take claires daughter

claire to venice to see byron and make arrangements for visiting allegra byron invited the shelleys to stay at his summer residence at este and shelley urged mary to meet him there clara became seriously ill on the journey and died on 24 september in venice following claras death mary fell into a long period of depression and emotional estrangement from shelley\\nthe shelleys moved to naples on 1 december where they stayed for three months during this period shelley was ill depressed and almost suicidal a state of mind reflected in his poem stanzas written in dejection  december 1818 near naples\\nwhile in naples shelley registered the birth and baptism of a baby girl elena adelaide shelley born 27 december naming himself as the father and falsely naming mary as the mother the parentage of elena has never been conclusively established biographers have variously speculated that she was adopted by shelley to console mary for the loss of clara that she was shelleys child to claire that she was his child to his servant elise foggi or that she was the child of a mysterious lady who had followed shelley to the continent shelley registered the birth and baptism on 27 february 1819 and the household left naples for rome the following day leaving elena with carers elena was to die in a poor suburb of naples on 9 june 1820\\nin rome shelley was in poor health

the cenci is a verse drama of rape murder and incest based on the story of the renaissance count cenci of rome and his daughter beatrice shelley completed the play in september and the first edition was published that year it was to become one of his most popular works and the only one to have two authorised editions in his lifetime\\nshelleys threeyearold son william died in june probably of malaria the new tragedy caused a further decline in shelleys health and deepened marys depression on 4 august she wrote we have now lived five years together and if all the events of the five years were blotted out i might be happythe shelleys were now living in livorno where in september shelley heard of the peterloo massacre of peaceful protesters in manchester within two weeks he had completed one of his most famous political poems the mask of anarchy and despatched it to leigh hunt for publication hunt however decided not to publish it for fear of prosecution for seditious libel the poem was only officially published in 1832\\nthe shelleys moved to florence in october where shelley read a scathing review of the revolt of islam and its earlier version laon and cythna in the

with the irish republican margaret mason lady margaret mountcashell and her commonlaw husband george william tighe mrs mason became the inspiration for shelleys poem the sensitive plant and shelleys discussions with mason and tighe influenced his political thought and his critical interest in the population theories of thomas malthus\\nin march shelley wrote to friends that mary was depressed suicidal and hostile towards him shelley was also beset by financial worries as creditors from england pressed him for payment and he was obliged to make secret payments in connection with his neapolitan charge elena\\nmeanwhile shelley was writing a philosophical view of reform a political essay which he had begun in rome the unfinished essay which remained unpublished in shelleys lifetime has been called one of the most advanced and sophisticated documents of political philosophy in the nineteenth century\\nanother crisis erupted in june when shelley claimed that he had been assaulted in the pisan post office by a man accusing him of foul crimes shelleys biographer james bieri suggests that this incident was possibly a delusional episode brought on by extreme stress as shelley was being blackmailed by a former servant paolo foggi over baby elena it is likely that the blackmail was connected with a story spread by another former servant elise foggi that shelley had fathered a child to claire in naples and had sent it to a foundling home shelley claire and mary denied this story and elise later recanted\\nin july hearing that john keats was seriously ill in england shelley wrote to the poet inviting him to stay with him at pisa keats replied with hopes of seeing him but instead arrangements were made for keats to travel to rome following the death of keats in 1821

unacknowledged legislators of the world remained unpublished in his lifetime\\nshelley went alone to ravenna in early august to see byron making a detour to livorno for a rendezvous with claire shelley stayed with byron for two weeks and invited the older poet to spend the winter in pisa after shelley heard byron read his newly completed fifth canto of don juan he wrote to mary i despair of rivalling byron\\nin november byron moved into villa lanfranchi in pisa just across the river from the shelleys byron became the centre of the pisan circle which was to include shelley thomas medwin edward williams and edward trelawny\\nin the early months of 1822 shelley became increasingly close to jane williams who was living with her partner edward williams in the same building as the shelleys shelley wrote a number of love poems for jane including the serpent is shut out of paradise and with a guitar to jane shelleys obvious affection for jane was to cause increasing tension between shelley edward williams and mary\\nclaire arrived in pisa in april at shelleys invitation and soon after they heard that her daughter allegra had died of typhus in ravenna the shelleys and claire then moved to villa magni near lerici on the shores of the gulf of la spezia shelley acted as mediator between claire and byron over arrangements for the burial of their daughter and the added strain led to shelley having a series of hallucinations\\nmary almost died from a miscarriage on 16 june her life only being saved by shelleys effective first aid two days later shelley wrote to a friend that there was no sympathy between mary and him and if the past and future could be obliterated he would be content in his boat with jane and her guitar that same day he also wrote to trelawny

8 july shelley williams and their boat boy sailed out of livorno for lerici a few hours later the don juan and its inexperienced crew were lost in a storm the vessel an open boat had been custombuilt in genoa for shelley mary shelley declared in her note on poems of 1822 1839 that the design had a defect and that the boat was never seaworthy in fact the don juan was overmasted the sinking was due to a severe storm and poor seamanship of the three men on board\\nshelleys badlydecomposed body washed ashore at viareggio ten days later and was identified by trelawny from the clothing and a copy of keatss lamia in a jacket pocket on 16 august his body was cremated on a beach near viareggio and the ashes were buried in the protestant cemetery of rome\\nthe day after the news of his death reached england the tory london newspaper the courier printed shelley the writer of some infidel poetry has been drowned now he knows whether there is god or no\\nshelleys ashes were reburied in a different plot at the cemetery in 1823 his grave bears the latin inscription cor cordium heart of hearts and a few lines of ariels song from shakespeares the tempestnothing of him that doth fadebut doth suffer a sea changeinto something rich and strange\\nshelleys heart\\nwhen shelleys body was cremated on the beach his unusually small heart resisted burning possibly due to calcification from an earlier tubercular infection trelawny gave the scorched heart to hunt who preserved it in spirits of wine and refused to hand it over to mary he finally relented and the heart was eventually buried either at st peters church bournemouth or in christchurch priory\\nfamily history\\nshelleys paternal grandfather was bysshe shelley 21 june 1731  6 january 1815 who in 1806 became sir bysshe shelley first baronet of castle goring on sir bysshes death in 1815 shelleys father inherited the baronetcy becoming sir timothy shelley\\nshelley was the eldest of several legitimate children bieri argues that shelley had an older illegitimate brother but if he existed little is known of him his younger siblings were john 18061866 margaret 18011887 hellen 17991885 mary 17971884 hellen 17961796 died in infancy and elizabeth 17941831\\nshelley had two children by his first wife harriet eliza ianthe shelley 18131876 and charles bysshe shelley 18141826 he had four children by his second wife mary an unnamed daughter born in 1815 who only survived ten days william shelley 18161819 clara everina shelley 18171818 and percy florence shelley 18191889 shelley also declared himself to be the father of elena adelaide shelley 18181820 who might have been an illegitimate or adopted daughter his son percy florence became the third baronet of castle goring in 1844 following the death of sir timothy shelley\\npolitical religious and ethical views\\npolitics\\nshelley was a political radical who was influenced by thinkers such as rousseau paine godwin wollstonecraft and leigh hunt he advocated catholic emancipation republicanism parliamentary reform the extension of the franchise freedom of speech and peaceful assembly an end to aristocratic and clerical privilege and a more equal distribution of income and wealth the views he expressed in his published works were often more moderate than those he advocated privately because of the risk of prosecution for seditious libel and his desire not to alienate more moderate friends and political allies nevertheless his political writings and activism brought him to the attention of the home office and he came under government surveillance at various periods\\nshelleys most influential political work in the years immediately following his death was the poem queen mab which included extensive notes on political themes the work went through 14 official and pirated editions by 1845 and became popular in owenist and chartist circles his longest political essay a philosophical view of reform was written in 1820 but not published until 1920\\nnonviolence\\nshelleys advocacy of nonviolent resistance was largely based on his reflections on the french revolution and rise of napoleon and his belief that violent protest would increase the prospect of a military despotism although shelley sympathised with supporters of irish independence such as peter finnerty and robert emmet he did not support violent rebellion in his early pamphlet an address to the irish people 1812 he wrote i do not wish to see things changed now because it cannot be done without violence and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change however good if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right\\nin his later essay a philosophical view of reform shelley did concede that there were political circumstances in which force might be justified the last resort of resistance is undoubtably sic insurrection the right of insurrection is derived from the employment of armed force to counteract the will of the nation shelley supported the 1820 armed rebellion against absolute monarchy in spain and the 1821 armed greek uprising against ottoman rule\\nshelleys poem the mask of anarchy written in 1819 but first published in 1832 has been called perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent resistance gandhi was familiar with the poem and it is possible that shelley had an indirect influence on gandhi through henry david thoreaus civil disobedience\\nreligion\\nshelley was an avowed atheist who was influenced by the materialist arguments in holbachs le systme de la nature his atheism was an important element of his political radicalism as he saw organised religion as inextricably linked to social oppression the overt and implied atheism in many of his works raised a serious risk of prosecution for religious libel his early pamphlet the necessity of atheism was withdrawn from sale soon after publication following a complaint from a priest his poem queen mab which includes sustained attacks on the priesthood christianity and religion in general was twice prosecuted by the society for the suppression of vice in 1821 a number of his other works were edited before publication to reduce the risk of prosecution\\nfree love\\nshelleys advocacy of free love drew heavily on the work of mary wollstonecraft and the early work of william godwin in his notes to queen mab he wrote a system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage he argued that the children of unhappy marriages are nursed in a systematic school of illhumour violence and falsehood he believed that the ideal of chastity outside marriage was a monkish and evangelical superstition which led to the hypocrisy of prostitution and promiscuity\\nshelley believed that sexual connection should be free among those who loved each other and last only as long as their mutual love love should also be free and not subject to obedience jealousy and fear he denied that free love would lead to promiscuity and the disruption of stable human relationships arguing that relationships based on love would generally be of long duration and marked by generosity and selfdevotion\\nwhen shelleys friend t j hogg made an unwanted sexual advance to shelleys first wife harriet shelley forgave him of his horrible error and assured him that he was not jealous it is very likely that shelley encouraged hogg and shelleys second wife mary to have a sexual relationship\\nvegetarianism\\nshelley converted to a vegetable diet in early march 1812 and sustained it with occasional lapses for the remainder of his life shelleys vegetarianism was influenced by ancient authors such as hesiod pythagoras socrates plato ovid and plutarch but more directly by john frank newton author of the return to nature or a defence of the vegetable regimen 1811 shelley wrote two essays on vegetarianism a vindication of natural diet 1813 and on the vegetable system of diet written circa 18131815 but first published in 1929 william owen jones argues that shelleys advocacy of vegetarianism was strikingly modern emphasising its health benefits the alleviation of animal suffering the inefficient use of agricultural land involved in animal husbandry and the economic inequality resulting from the commercialisation of animal food production shelleys life and works inspired the founding of the vegetarian society in england 1847 and directly influenced the vegetarianism of george bernard shaw and perhaps gandhi\\nreception and influence\\nshelleys work was not widely read in his lifetime outside a small circle of friends poets and critics most of his poetry drama and fiction was published in editions of 250 copies which generally sold poorly only the cenci went to an authorised second edition while shelley was alive  in contrast byrons the corsair 1814 sold out its first edition of 10000 copies in one day\\nthe initial reception of shelleys work in mainstream periodicals with the exception of the liberal examiner was generally unfavourable reviewers often launched personal attacks on shelleys private life and political social and religious views even when conceding that his poetry contained beautiful imagery and poetic expression there was also criticism of shelleys intelligibility and style hazlitt describing it as a passionate dream a straining after impossibilities a record of fond conjectures a confused embodying of vague abstraction\\nshelleys poetry soon gained a wider audience in radical and reformist circles queen mab became popular with owenists and chartists and revolt of islam influenced poets sympathetic to the workers movement such as thomas hood thomas cooper and william morris\\nhowever shelleys mainstream following did not develop until a generation after his death bieri argues that editions of shelleys poems published in 1824 and 1839 were edited by mary shelley to highlight her late husbands lyrical gifts and downplay his radical ideas matthew arnold famously described shelley as a beautiful and ineffectual angel\\nshelley was a major influence on a number of important poets in the following decades including robert browning swinburne hardy and yeats shelleylike characters frequently appeared in nineteenthcentury literature such as scythrop in peacocks nightmare abbey ladislaw in george eliots middlemarch and angel clare in hardys tess of the durbervilles\\ntwentiethcentury critics such as eliot leavis allen tate and auden variously criticised shelleys poetry for deficiencies in style repellent ideas and immaturity of intellect and sensibility however shelleys critical reputation rose from the 1960s as a new generation of critics highlighted shelleys debt to spenser and milton his mastery of genres and verse forms and the complex interplay of sceptical idealist and materialist ideas in his work american literary critic harold bloom describes him as a superb craftsman a lyric poet without rival and surely one of the most advanced sceptical intellects ever to write a poem according to donald h reiman shelley belongs to the great tradition of western writers that includes dante shakespeare and milton\\nlegacy\\nshelley died leaving many of his works unfinished unpublished or published in expurgated versions with multiple errors there have been a number of recent projects aimed at establishing reliable editions of his manuscripts and works among the most notable of these are\\nshelleys longlost poetical essay on the existing state of things 1811 was rediscovered in 2006 and subsequently made available online by the bodleian library in oxford\\njohn lauritsen and charles e robinson have argued that shelleys contribution to mary shelleys novel frankenstein was extensive and that he should be considered a collaborator or coauthor professor charlotte gordon and others have disputed this contention fiona sampson has said in recent years percys corrections visible in the frankenstein notebooks held at the bodleian library in oxford have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least coauthored the novel in fact when i examined the notebooks myself i realised that percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today\\nthe keatsshelley memorial association founded in 1903 supports the keatsshelley house in rome

the collective volume antologia primverii the anthology of spring he was at the time an adherent to surrealism and a volume of his surrealist poetry was supposed to be edited by editura fundaiilor regale but never saw print owing to the institutions disestablishment by the new communist authorities literary historian mircea braga writes that over the following years baconsky showed himself to be a staunch critic of surrealism and quotes him defining andr bretons pupils as followers of a rigid dogma literary critic and academic diana cmpan also that the split with surrealism and the avantgarde was a sign of his belief that negation could only result in value if substantiated as well as his theory that aesthetic revolt after manifesting itself as a disease was degenerating into

collaborating with almanahul literar a newly founded magazine edited by communist poet miron radu paraschivescu which in 1954 was renamed steaua among his early assignments there was his participation on the literary jury that granted the magazines annual prize alongside literary men such as paraschivescu emil isac dumitru micu and iosif pervain in one notable incident of 1950 the panel honored a high school student named ion motoarc without being aware that motoarcs communist poetry was in fact a parody of socialist realist literature authored as a prank by baconskys rival doina as was revealed decades later doina continued to ridicule the steaua writers over several months and when he decided that the risk of repercussions was far too great simply put an end to the prank this he did by having motoarc decline all of baconskys suggestions with the claim that one should not take lessons from a less gifted poet than himself in parallel anatol e baconskys relationship with paraschivescu was tense in february 1951 at a usr meeting in bucharest he was one of those who criticized baconskys new take on lyric poetry accusing him of intimism\\nhowever in 1952 paraschivescu

communist leader gheorghe gheorghiudej not to endorse liberalization and destalinization particularly after the events in hungary threatened to disrupt communism throughout the eastern bloc and at a time when the regime condemned advocates of change miron constantinescu mihail davidoglu alexandru jar and ion vitner\\nanatol e baconsky was again present in poetry with the 1957 volume dincolo de

target of criticism in the literary community the reaction braga noted was vehement and in january 1959 got baconsky dismissed from his position as editor of steaua in october of that year the poet left cluj and settled in bucharest according to ungureanu the capital was hostile to baconsky and the move was the equivalent of an internal exile\\nover the following decade he focused mainly on

that time\\nhis 1973 anthology of world poetry panorama poeziei universale the panorama of universal poetry was noted by hungarian literary historian jnos kohn among similar romanian works of the period including ion caraions collection of american poetry as an important step in the history of romanian translations the book based on the meridiane lirice program comprised works by 99 authors

circulated in samizdat form and was made into a series by the munichbased radio free europe which broadcast clandestinely inside romania\\nin march 1977 baconsky and his wife clara fell victims to the 72 mw vrancea earthquake which devastated bucharest at the time baconsky was preparing for a new trip abroad complying with communist romanias restrictions on the use of passports he had just asked authorities to release the document and was carrying it on his person his last volumes biserica neagr and corabia lui sebastian sebastians ship remained unpublished\\nwork style and creative periods\\ncommunism and socialist realism\\nafter his short affiliation to surrealism a style which is almost entirely absent from his published work baconsky embraced a style which reflected his communist sympathies and which is most often seen as the source of some of his poorest work cornel ungureanu describes the early 1950s baconsky as an exponent of socialist realism and a passionate supporter of the communist utopia his stance in respect to the authorities was described by literary historian alex dracefrancis as conformist a word also used by clinescu while paul cernat circumscribes baconsky to the pure and tough stalinism of the day\\nhis early works are seen by literary critic sorin tomua as an unfortunate debut with conjectural lyrics likened by matei clinescu to the debut writings of the younger communist author dan deliu they became the topic of criticism from as early as the nicolae ceauescu years mircea braga called them platitudes and at most documents for a certain mindset and artistic practice noting that their own author had come to reject them in later years he also cites fellow critic alexandru piru who defines baconskys early productions as bearing the strong imprint of journalism\\nthis series included controversial stanzas about communization the romanian collectivization process and class struggle against wealthy peasants known as chiaburi romanian for kulaks other portions of his work were dedicated to industrialization policies around subjects related to brad factories discussing his projects for 1952 in an interview with contemporanul baconsky explained i am especially interested in the matter of engineers who rose from the ranks of young workers i want to follow their transformation on all levels and create the figure of a young engineer in one of my poems one of his bestknown poems of the period has to do with the chiaburi and includes the lines\\nother such lyrics read\\nformer romanian communist party activist pavel ugui whose opinions diverged from the party line claimed that in effect baconsky was writing with subversive undertones from the time of his debutliterary chronicler bogdan creu renders this opinion but expresses doubt calling ugui dubious and in reality a politruk as sinister as all the others literary historian eugen simion also proposed that baconsky was in effect parodying agitprop literature of the day analyzing baconskys early political views his biographer crina bud concludes that the poet was attracted into cooperation in order to make a living and that from the very start he was playing a number of different and conflicting roles\\nthe writer was already noted for being a man of refined tastes and for being interested by universal culture both creu and cernat define him as a dandy of communism the dandy trait had also been noted by eugen simion simion who recorded his impression of baconsky spoke of his romantic beauty sartorial elegance and a form of melancholy which he argued recalled that displayed by 19th century author grard de nerval historian vladimir tismneanu sees anatol e baconsky as one of the few genuine leftwing intellectuals who remained associated with the regime throughout the 1950s in his definition the group also comprised geo bogza ovid crohmlniceanu geo dumitrescu petru dumitriu paul georgescu gheorghe haupt eugen jebeleanu mihail petroveanu and nicolae tertulian\\nduring his period at steaua baconsky encouraged young authors to express themselves and created what both tomua and creu define as a literary oasis tismneanu however criticizes the writer and other leftists on the cultural scene for not reacting against the post1956 repressive mood and argues that their inaction helped ideologists leonte rutu and his subordinate mihai beniuc to restore gheorghe gheorghiudejs control over the writers union\\na particular controversy involves allegations against the young baconsky for the way in which he treated his colleagues many voices in the literary community have come to suspect that he was an informant for the securitate secret police and that his reports helped in the arrest of other writers crina bud proposes that if such accounts are true baconsky may have used the securitate in order to silence those who competed with him for the approval of his teacher philosopher lucian blaga the accusations are traced by cernat to two separate sources baconskys adversaries in the sibiu literary circle and securitate general nicolae plei during his early activities in cluj baconsky is also alleged to have partaken in the marginalization of a less enthusiastic writer ion dezideriu srbu who was later to become a political prisoner in srbus memoirs baconsky is singled out as one of those who betrayed his confidence\\nbreak with communism\\ndespite initially complying with ideological requirements baconsky was often subject to criticism in the official press this occurred frequently after 1953 when soviet politico georgy malenkov disavowed proletkult criticizing its exponents for having authored a bland and distant form of literature an accusation which baconsky was regularly faced with from that moment on criticism was expressed early on by poet veronica porumbacu who reproached him having published too little when the people is asking us to participate with all forces in the struggle also in 1953 paul georgescu literary columnist at scnteia the main communist party organ reacted against the steaua leadership and argued that baconsky personally had developed a highflown style designed to hide his unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas georgescu also claimed that baconskys travel accounts had failed to show how bulgarian people live how this country looks today  and that his poems displayed various ideological mistakes writing for viaa romneasc critic eugen campus endorsed earlier pronouncements and added that although baconsky was a talented poet he found his contributions showed a tendency to repeat oneselffor all the originality it covets literary historian ana selejan notes that upon the end of the debates the poet found himself was blacklisted by the official critics\\nin parallel baconsky criticized other writers on similar grounds he aimed such remarks at his fellow poet eugen frunz which brought him additional criticism from georgescu and mircea gafia several of baconskys poems in particular the 1953 rutin routine satirize authors who did not seek to make their poems interesting to the general public the latter selejan proposes may be a covert reference to and ironic pastiche of mihai beniuc one of the socialist realist poets most trusted by the regime one of the stanzas reads\\nselejan also notes that rutin like the war poem manifest manifesto constitute a dissonant note when compared with other poems of the day including those of beniuc manifest which may have been written in honor of the romanianhosted world festival of youth and students 1953 and which selejan believes may display irony toward poetic militantism in the present tense compares the fate of world war ii soldiers with that of post1945 youth in meditative lyrics such as\\nprogressively after the late 1950s baconsky entirely lost his confidence in communisman attitude which culminated in his 1972 protest his disappointment was especially known to his intimate circle based on this cernat defines the writer as an informal anticommunist while clinescu who recalls participating in such conversations notes baconsky displayed an emphatic lucid irreconcilable anticommunism not even later  did i meet many people who had a more emphasized contempt mixed with an intense repulsion for the representatives of the communist party ideology either within the literary world or outside it he believes baconskys stance from 1958 onwards makes him the periods only dissident although he also notes that the poet criticized the communist system only orally cornel ungureanu who stresses the importance of both his move to bucharest and the numerous visits abroad adds he was to walk down a road which most celebrity authors of the 1950s communist east  have walked down on the one between fanatical exaltation and acute misanthropies according to bogdan creu 1967 when echinoxul nebunilor was published was the capital moment in baconskys noncompliance with the ideological requirements with more than honorable behavior defining the second part of his career however cernat speculates the theory regarding his alleged collaboration to securitate may offer clue that baconskys new stance was itself orchestrated by the party in an attempt to offer him credibility and permit him to sabotage the literary environment\\nbaconsky allowed his intellectual opposition to communism to merge with his activities as a cultural promoter in addition to promoting the work of george bacovia baconsky had sought to republish the works of mateiu caragiale and his decadent novel craii de curteaveche but his efforts had been frustrated and according to eugen simion their only effect was that scnteia resumed its earlier campaign against caragiale in the climate of relative liberalization coinciding with nicolae ceauescus early years in office his anthologies and essays helped reinstate works of literature who had been previously censored ungureanu thus notes that baconsky reintroduced the romanian public to works of central european authors such as franz kafka and ingeborg bachmann and argues he is the first one or among the first ones to reconquer the mitteleuropean space for romanian culture cernat portrays him as a european humanist with a vast and refined culture while creu proposes that baconsky and his generation colleague tefan augustin doina may be romanias best translators of poetry by 1970 baconskys younger colleague gabriel dimisianu notes he had become one of the writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism and now were silently parting with it returning to literature to actual criticism this group defined by dimisianu as the older allies of my generation also includes paraschivescu geo bogza ovid crohmlniceanu geo dumitrescu eugen jebeleanu marin preda zaharia stancu as well as baconskys former rival paul georgescu\\nlyrical transition\\nfollowing his break with the regime baconskys style underwent major changes tomua notes he became a firstrate stylist while doina stresses his discreet but tenacious selfedification leading to an ardent consciousness albeit perhaps belatedly gained the new direction heralded during his time at steaua was however muchcriticized by the 1950s cultural establishment who accused him of intimism and excessive lyricism and argued that his work was a return to aestheticism and symbolism baconsky resisted such criticism and in one of his articles openly stated that poets needed to return to a lyrical approach ignoring the rich array of intimate feelings means mutilating the protagonists personality depicting him unilaterally belittling the actual dimensions of his soul matei clinescu argues that such a commitment to artistic purity was a sign of what we could call the aesthetic resistance to communism\\naccording to badea such experiments resulted in baconskys originality an antimetaphoric offensive built upon the confrontation between the life of lyrical characters with the destiny of ideal lives the rejection of decorative metaphors cernat notes was a staple of baconskys work and was explicitly stated in his post1969 essays badea added that this dincolo de iarn and the volumes which followed down to 1965 formed the first page in a distinct chapter of our modern lyric poetry eugen simion emphasized as the common trait of such poems a voluptuousness in things fading away in the weariness provoked by the whispers of rain in his definition baconsky had become an aesthete of melancholy\\nbaconskys poems of the period speak of himself being torn by the contradictions of destiny submitted to the command of a nature whose geography braga notes is dead seeking to undermine his own humanity so as to become the ideal creator also according to mircea braga the manifesto of baconskys onthologic unease is his imn ctre nelinite hymn to disquiet\\nit was also at this stage that the poet began introducing references to remote or exotic locations in his works his poems began to speak of mysterious baltic and northern european landscapes of ancient roads medieval settings and the desolation of history as well as of romanias natural sights the danube delta and the carpathian mountains and scenes from romanian history involving the dacians the scythes and the thracians or the moldavian prince stephen the great the pieces show his enduring fascination with water environments references to which according to braga he used to illustrate the allencompassing dynamic\\ncadavre n vid and corabia lui sebastian\\nwith the somber collection cadavre n vid baconsky entered what braga calls a forth artistic phase after surrealism socialist realism and the first change in orientation braga however insists that the change between the final two phases is not radical and that they are separated by a break rather than a tear braga also believes that in his depictions of melancholy and disease baconsky again focuses on unease and the denial of the irreplaceable while letting the reader know that such a denial is useless and inefficient in a 1985 essay poet and critic dinu flmnd discusses cadavre n vid as a book of suffering unique in our literature a tragic perception of the disinherited a nightmare of teratologic dreams in the new electronic season  it includes sonet negru black sonnet which braga calls an exceptional sample of feverish tensions infinite searches  obscure impulses\\nmircea braga writes that this and other late volumes showing a world born out of nightmares are the product of several influences alongside george bacovias melancholic poems they host echoes from both expressionism and postmodern literature flmnd ranks the posthumous corabia lui sebastian among the best works written in this second half of the 20th century and compares its cynicism to the existential philosophy of emil cioran\\nby that stage baconsky also became noted for theorizing the rejection of consumerism advocating instead a return to established cultural values according to flmnds 1985 essay baconskys rejection of consumerism and the west was decisive and culminated in a virulent decision of what baconsky is known to have called the occidental pharaoh braga also writes that in both cadavre n vid and corabia lui sebastian baconsky depicts his own version of a crisis of the west the abendland forming a setting of one poem which he believed may have referenced oswald spenglers similar verdict see the decline of the west diana cmpan noted the poems dystopian imagery the abendland is  an eerie leviathanlike corpus with attributes defining for humanitys decrepitude a surrogate antiutopian citadel handled in accordance with the laws of decline which grind the elites as well as the masses the things as well their reflection a part of the eponymous poem reads\\naccording to mircea braga one of his last interviews shows that while still criticized for aestheticism baconsky merged his lyricism with an interest in social matters the statement reads the writer is not a politician in the common and consecrated sense of the word he does however have the role of a spiritual ferment italics in the original he must not allow people to acquire cerebral obesity he is always dissatisfied with something or other his position is that of a permanent antithesis with the surrounding reality braga believes baconskys moral rigor to bear a transylvanian sign and to have been ultimately inspired by the philosophy of lucian blaga the related anticapitalist vision is questioned by cernat the critic indicates that although sincere in its patriotism it was also compatible with the mixture of communism and nationalism introduced by the ceauescu regime see national communism and thus similar with the philosophical discourse of constantin noica\\nlate prose works\\nwith remember dracefrancis argues baconsky advanced a technique first used by avantgarde writers of the 1930s which transcended the norms imposed by traditional travel accounts in order to express the inadequate representational possibilities of traditional forms and to comment on the metaphysics of reality baconsky thus depicts his journey as an interior adventure this type of discourse dracefrancis contends was a hint to his readers that the regime would not allow him to recount every detail of his journey the book nevertheless also doubles as baconskys extended critique of the avantgarde of europe whose discourse diana cmpan notes baconsky depicted as a form of desecration in tomuas view the depiction of vienna with a focus on the glorious vestiges of the past takes the reader on a voluptuous time travel in the critics definition baconskys vienna encloses a secondary reality that is ideal aestheticized fictional and bookish\\ndracefrancis also notes that the climate of relative liberalization and dtente of the 1960s not only made such journeys possible but actually allowed writers the freedom to go beyond stereotyped depictions of capitalism while it remained uncertain whether communist romanias dialog with the west would dominate the construction of epistemic value overall cornel ungureanu comments baconskys accounts of his western travels are marked by dark visions of the world ungureanu sees this as a sign of baconskys having descended into hell cernat who extends his critique of baconskys anticapitalist attitude to remember also argues that the authors absolute freedom of travel under a repressive regime indicates that his work was not perceived as a threat by the communist system\\nbaconskys prose fiction is closely linked to the themes and style of his poetry in bragas view the fantasy collection echinoxul nebunilor is a prosaic representative of its authors early commitment to aestheticism according to cernat its tone is apocalyptic a characteristic of baconskys prose fiction is its resemblance to his poetry works to the point where they were described by crina bud as hybrid forms in bogdan creus view biserica neagr baconskys only novel is written with alexandrinelike purity likewise the corabia lui sebastian poems were noted for moving into the realm of prose this transgression of limits summoned objections from prominent literary critic nicolae manolescu who reportedly believed baconskys work to be largely without merit\\nbiserica neagr is also read as his most subversive work described by critics as a counterutopia ungureanu sees it as a kafkaesque work of absurdist inspiration and a further sign of the author descending into hell crina bud links the antiutopian quality to contemporary writings by among others matei clinescu viaa i opiniile lui zacharias lichter the life and opinions of zacharias lichter and baconskys friend octavian paler viaa pe un peronlife on a platform un om norocosa lucky man written from the perspective of a sculptor who is probably a transposition of baconsky himself it is a parable of totalitarian command artistic submission individual despair and withdrawal the volume also offers a glimpse into the world of political imprisonment under communism\\nlegacy\\nanatol e baconsky was a noted presence in the literary community of his day and is believed to have influenced poet novelist and translator petre stoica who is described by ungureanu as the writers friend and emulator baconskys poems were parodied by marin sorescu in his 1964 volume singur printre poei alone among poets sorescus poem titled a e baconsky imn ctre necunoscutul din mine hymn to the unknown within me makes use of baconskys lyrical style and displays of culture showing the poet meditating about the ancient scythian and thracian peoples it begins with the lines\\nunusual episodes involving baconskys death were reported by two of his writer friends octavian paler and petre stoicapaler recalled that the only book to have fallen out of his shelf during the 1977 earthquake was remember stoica told a similar story involving a painting that baconsky had made and which he had received as a gift the writers death cernat writes was a troubling coincidence with that of alexandru ivasiuc a former communist who like baconsky had radicalized his vision and authored nonconformist pieces ivasiuc was himself a victim of the 1977 earthquake\\nin the months following baconskys death his new monograph on sandro botticelli centered on the artists illustrations for dante aligheris divine comedy was published in romanian reissued

a time when there were few publications devoted to conservative commentary he served as the magazines editorinchief until 1990 during that time national review became the standardbearer of american

were excommunists or had once worked on the far left including whittaker chambers willi schlamm john dos passos frank meyer and james burnham as editors and writers for national review when burnham became a senior editor he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center smant 1991 finds that burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board including meyer schlamm william rickenbacker and the magazines publisher william a rusher and had a significant impact on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of buckley himself\\ndefining the boundaries of conservatism\\nbuckley and his editors used national review to define the boundaries of conservatism and to exclude people ideas or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title for example buckley denounced ayn rand the john birch society george wallace racists white supremacists and antisemites\\nwhen he first met author ayn rand according to buckley she greeted him with the following you are much too intelligent to believe in god in turn buckley felt that rands style as well as her message clashed with the conservative ethos he decided that rands hostility to religion made her philosophy unacceptable to his understanding of conservatism after 1957 he attempted to weed her out of the conservative movement by publishing whittaker chamberss highly negative review of rands atlas shrugged in 1964 he wrote of her desiccated philosophys conclusive incompatibility with the conservatives emphasis on transcendence intellectual and moral as well as the incongruity of tone that hard schematic implacable unyielding dogmatism that is in itself intrinsically objectionable whether it comes from the mouth of ehrenburg savonarolaor ayn rand other attacks on rand were penned by garry wills and m stanton evans nevertheless burns argues her popularity and her influence on the right forced buckley and his circle into a reconsideration of how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with allout support for capitalism\\nduring the 1950s buckley worked to remove antisemitism from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for national review\\nin 1962 buckley denounced robert w welch jr and the john birch society in national review as far removed from common sense and urged the republican party to purge itself of welchs influence\\non robert welch and the john birch society\\nin 1952 their mutual publisher henry regnery introduced william f buckley jr to robert welch both buckley and welch became editors of political journals and both had a knack for communication and organization welch launched his publication one mans opinion in 1956 renamed american opinion in 1958 one year after the founding of the national review welch twice donated 1000 to buckleys magazine and buckley offered to provide welch a little publicity for his publication both believed that the united states suffered from diplomatic and military setbacks during the early years of the cold war and both were staunchly anticommunist but welch expressed doubts about eisenhowers loyalties in 1957 and the two disagreed on the reasons for the united states perceived failure in the cold wars early years according to alvin felzenbergs assessment the disagreements between the two blossomed into a major battle in 1958 that year boris pasternak won the nobel prize in literature for his novel doctor zhivago buckley was impressed by the novels vivid and depressing depictions of life in a communist society and believed that the cias smuggling of the novel into the soviet union was an ideological victory in september 1958 buckley ran a review of doctor zhivago by john chamberlain in november 1958 welch sent buckley and other associates copies of his unpublished manuscript the politician which accused eisenhower and several of eisenhowers appointees of involvement in a communist conspiracy when buckley returned the manuscript to welch he commented that the allegations were curiouslyalmost pathetically optimistic on december 9 1958 welch founded the john birch society with a group of business leaders in indianapolis by the end of 1958 welch had both the organizational and the editorial infrastructure to launch his subsequent farright political advocacy campaigns\\nin 1961 reflecting on his correspondences with welch and birchers buckley told someone who subscribed to both the national review and the john birch society i have had more discussions about the john birch society in the past year than i have about the existence of god or the financial difficulties of national review\\nviews on race and segregation\\nin the 1950s and early 1960s buckley opposed federal civil rights legislation and expressed support for continued racial segregation in the south in freedom is not enough the opening of the american workplace author nancy maclean states that national review made james j kilpatricka prominent supporter of segregation in the southits voice on the civil rights movement and the constitution as buckley and kilpatrick united north and south in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy in the august 24 1957 issue of national review buckleys editorial why the south must prevail spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the south until long term equality could be achieved buckley opined that temporary segregation in the south was necessary at the time because the black population lacked the education economic and cultural development to make racial equality possible buckley claimed that the white south had the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races buckley said white southerners were entitled to disenfranchise black voters because for the time being it is the advanced race buckley characterized blacks as distinctly ignorant the great majority of the negroes of the south who do not vote do not care to vote and would not know for what to vote if they could two weeks after that editorial was published another prominent conservative writer l brent bozell jr buckleys brotherinlaw wrote in the national review this magazine has expressed views on the racial question that i consider dead wrong and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes there is a law involved and a constitution and the editorial gives white southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the negro politically impotent\\npolitico indicates that during the administration of lyndon b johnson buckleys writing grew more accommodating toward the civil rights movement in his columns he ridiculed practices designed to keep african americans off the voter registration rolls condemned proprietors of commercial establishments who declined service to african americans in violation of the recently enacted 1964 civil rights act and showed little patience for southern politicians who incited racial violence and racebaited in their campaigns but he disagreed with the concept of structural racism and placed a large amount of blame for lack of economic growth on the black community itself most prominently during a highly publicized 1965 debate at the cambridge union with africanamerican writer james baldwin in which baldwin carried the floor vote 544 to 164 in the late 1960s buckley disagreed with segregationist george wallace of alabama debating against wallaces segregationist platform on a january 1968 episode of firing line\\nbuckley later said he wished national review had been more supportive of civil rights legislation in the 1960s he grew to admire martin luther king jr and supported the creation of martin luther king jr day in 2004 buckley told time i once believed we could evolve our way up from jim crow i was wrong federal intervention was necessary the same year he endeavored to clarify his earlier comments on race saying the point i made about white cultural supremacy was sociological buckley also linked his usage of the word advancement to its usage in the name naacp saying that the call for the advancement of colored people presupposes they are behind which they were in 1958 by any standards of measurement\\nanticommunism and support for military dictatorships\\nbuckleys opposition to communism extended to support for the overthrow

of general augusto pinochet who led the 1973 coup that overthrew chilean president salvador allendes democratically elected marxist government buckley referred to allende as a president who was defiling the chilean constitution and waving proudly the banner of his friend and idol fidel castro in 2020 the columbia journalism review uncovered documents that implicated buckley in a media campaign by the argentina military junta promoting the regimes image while covering up the dirty war\\nbuckley rule\\nthe buckley rule states that national review will support the rightwardmost viable candidate for a given office buckley first stated the buckley rule during the 1964 republican primary election featuring barry goldwater and nelson rockefeller the rule is often misquoted and misapplied as proclaiming support for the rightwardmost electable candidate or simply the most electable candidate\\naccording to national reviews neal b freeman the buckley rule meant that national

fee to enter the central city and creating a network of bike lanes he opposed a civilian review board for the new york police department which lindsay had recently introduced to control police corruption and install community policing buckley finished third with 134 of the vote possibly having inadvertently aided lindsays election by instead taking votes from democratic candidate abe beame\\nnixon administration\\nin july 1971 buckley assembled a group of conservatives to discuss some of nixons domestic and foreign policies that the group opposed in august 1969 nixon had proposed and later attempted to enact welfare legislation known as the family assistance plan fap which would establish a national income floor of 1600 per year for a family of four on the international front

antagonism toward buckley was well known even before 1968 buckley nevertheless appeared in a series of televised debates with vidal during the 1968 republican national convention in miami and the democratic national convention in chicago\\nin their penultimate debate on august 28 of that year the two disagreed over the actions of the chicago police department and the protesters at the convention in reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a viet cong flag moderator howard k smith asked whether raising a nazi flag during the second world war would have elicited a similar response vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit whereupon buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views noting that in the us during the second world war some people were pronazi and they were well ie correctly treated by those who ostracized themand im for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot american marines and american soldiers i know you vidal dont care because you have no sense of identification with vidal then interjected that the only sort of pro or cryptonazi i can think of is yourself whereupon smith interjected now lets not call names buckley visibly angered rose several inches from his seat and replied now listen you queer stop calling me a cryptonazi or ill sock you in your goddamn face and youll stay plastered\\nbuckley later apologized in print for having called vidal a queer in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context but also reiterated his distaste for vidal as an evangelist for bisexuality the man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction and in his art the desirability of it is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly the addict is to be pitied and even respected not the pusher the debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary best of enemies\\nthis feud continued the next year in esquire magazine which commissioned essays from buckley and vidal on the incident buckleys essay on experiencing gore vidal was published in the august 1969 issue in september vidal responded with his own essay a distasteful encounter with william f buckley in it vidal strongly implied that in 1944 buckleys unnamed siblings and possibly buckley had vandalized a protestant church in their sharon connecticut hometown after the pastors wife sold a house to a jewish family he also implied that buckley was homosexual and a racist antiblack antisemitic and a procrypto nazi buckley sued vidal and esquire for libel vidal countersued buckley for libel citing buckleys characterization of vidals novel myra breckenridge as pornography after buckley received an outofcourt settlement from esquire he dropped the suit against vidal both cases were dropped with buckley settling for court costs paid by esquire which had published the piece while vidal who did not sue the magazine absorbed his own court costs neither paid the other compensation buckley also received an editorial apology from esquire as part of the settlement\\nthe feud was reopened in 2003 when esquire republished the original vidal essay as part of a collection titled esquires big book of great writing after further litigation esquire agreed to pay 65000 to buckley and his attorneys to destroy every remaining copy of the book that included vidals essay to furnish buckleys 1969 essay to anyone who asked for it and to publish an open letter stating that esquires current management was not aware of the history of this litigation and greatly regretted the republication of the libels in the 2003 collection\\nbuckley maintained a

marry only if they agreed to sterilization and that universal testingled by insurance companies not the governmentshould be mandatory most controversially of all he wrote everyone detected with aids should be tattooed in the upper forearm to protect commonneedle users and on the buttocks to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals the piece led to much criticism some gay activists advocated boycotting patricia buckleys fundraising efforts for aids william buckley later backtracked from the piece but in 2004 he told the new york times magazine if the protocol had been accepted many who caught the infection unguardedly would be alive probably over a million\\nspy novelist\\nin 1975 buckley recounted being inspired to write a spy novel by frederick forsyths the day of the jackal if i

oakes new york times critic charlie rubin wrote that the series at its best evokes john ohara in its precise sense of place amid simmering class hierarchies stained glass second in the series won a 1980 national book award in the oneyear category mystery paperback\\nbuckley was particularly concerned about the view that what the cia and the kgb were doing was morally equivalent he wrote in his memoirs to say that the cia and the kgb engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus on the grounds that after all in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around\\nbuckley began writing on computers in 1982 starting with

to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous he added this isnt to say that the iraq war is wrong or that history will judge it to be

at national review online and distributed by universal press syndicate buckley stated unequivocally that one cannot doubt that the american objective in iraq has failed buckley also stated that its important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that the war has failed so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure\\naccording to jeffrey hart writing in the american conservative buckley had a tragic view of the iraq war he saw it as a disaster and thought that the conservative movement he had created had in effect committed intellectual suicide by failing to maintain critical distance from the bush administration\\xa0 at the end of his life buckley believed the movement he made had destroyed itself by supporting the war in iraq regarding the iraq war troop surge of 2007 however it was noted by the editors of national review that buckley initially opposed the surge but after seeing its early success believed it deserved more time to work\\nbuckley was an advocate for the legalization of marijuana and some other drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of new york city he wrote a pointed promarijuanalegalization piece for national review in 2004 in which he called for conservatives to change their views on legalization stating were not going to find someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws what is required is a genuine republican groundswell it is happening but ever so gradually two of every five americans\\xa0 believe the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol it should regulate it control it tax it and make it illegal only for children in his december 3 2007 column shortly after his wifes death which he attributed at least in part to her smoking buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in america\\nbuckley took a middle course on the issues of gay rights and sexual ethics he strongly opposed gay marriage but supported the legalization of homosexual relations buckley also wrote articles for playboy despite criticizing the magazine and its philosophy\\nabout neoconservatives he said in 2004 i think those i know which is most of them are bright informed and idealistic but that they simply overrate the reach of us power and influence\\ndeath and legacy\\nbuckley suffered from emphysema and diabetes in his later years in a december 2007 column he commented on the cause of his emphysema citing his lifelong habit of smoking tobacco despite endorsing a legal ban of it on february 27 2008 he died from a heart attack at his home in stamford connecticut at the age of 82 initially it was reported that he was found dead at his desk in his study a converted garage his son christopher buckley said he died with his boots on after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle but in his 2009 book losing mum and pup a memoir he admitted that this account was a slight embellishment on his part while his father died in his study he was found lying on the floor buckley was buried at the saint bernard cemetery in sharon connecticut next to his wife patricia\\nnotable members of the republican political establishment paying tribute to buckley included president george w bush former speaker of the house of representatives newt gingrich and former first lady nancy reagan bush said of buckley he influenced a lot of people including me he captured the imagination of a lot of people gingrich added bill buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy intelligence wit and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement  buckley began what led to senator barry goldwater and his conscience of a conservative that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the republican party from that emerged ronald reagan reagans widow nancy commented ronnie valued bills counsel throughout his political life and after ronnie died bill and pat were there for me in so many ways\\nvarious organizations have awards and honors named after buckley the intercollegiate studies institute awards the william f buckley award for outstanding campus journalism\\nlanguage and idiolect\\nbuckley was well known for his command of language he came late to formal instruction in english not learning it until he was seven years old and having earlier learned spanish and french michelle tsai in slate says that he spoke english with an idiosyncratic accent something between an oldfashioned upperclass midatlantic accent and british received pronunciation yet with a southern drawl\\nrhetoric\\nepstein 1972 argues that liberals were especially fascinated by buckley and often wanted to debate him in part because his ideas resembled their own for buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to leftliberal opinion rather than being founded on conservative principles that were alien to the liberals\\nappel 1992 argues from rhetorical theory that buckleys essays are often written in low burlesque in the manner of samuel butlers satirical poem hudibras considered as drama such discourse features blackandwhite disorder a guiltmongering logician distorted clownish opponents limited scapegoating and a selfserving redemption\\nlee 2008 argues that buckley introduced a new rhetorical style that conservatives often tried to emulate the gladiatorial style as lee calls it is flashy and combative filled with sound bites and leads to an inflammatory drama as conservatives encountered buckleys arguments about government liberalism and markets the theatrical appeal of buckleys gladiatorial style inspired conservative imitators becoming one of the principal templates for conservative rhetoric'}, {'title': 'Ramsey_Campbell', 'label': 'Writer', 'text': 'ramsey campbell born 4 january 1946 is an english horror fiction writer editor and critic who has been writing for well over fifty

fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of lovecraft country itself\\nin his early writings campbell used the setting of lovecrafts stories in the fictional new england area of the miskatonic river valley at the suggestion of fellow lovecraftian writer august derleth he rewrote many of his earliest stories which he had originally set in the massachusetts locales of arkham dunwich and innsmouth and moved them to english settings in and around the fictional gloucestershire city of brichester near the river severn creating his own severn valley milieu for lovecraftian horrors the invented locale of brichester is the main town of campbells severn valley and was deeply influenced by campbells native liverpool and much of his later work is set in the real

lovecraft while working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection demons by daylight but he later acknowledged lovecrafts lasting influence and his subsequent cthulhu mythos tales collected in cold print 1985 expanded in 1993 confirm the transition from pastiche to homage most notably in such tales as the faces at pine dunes and the eerily surreal the voice on the beach 1982 later work still seeks to ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by lovecraft particularly the novel the darkest part of the woods 2003 the novella the last revelation of glaaki 2013 and

expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work he finished the collection that would become demons by daylight in 1968 but it would not see print until 1973 meanwhile from 1969 to 1973 he continued

slipping into parody of his writing style other tales such as the end of a summers day and concussion show the emergence of campbells highly distinctive mature style of which s t joshi has written\\ncertainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style one of the most fluid dense and evocative in all modern literature  his eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects and his ability to express them crisply and almost prosepoetically give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense\\nthe books appearance induced t e d klein to write an extensive and highly positive review ramsey campbell an appreciation in nyctalops magazine and critic s t joshi has stated that\\nits  allusiveness of narration careful at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social

completed demons by daylight in 1968 i felt directionless and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales he wrote only four tales in 1970 and five stories in 1971 he has written that retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision to write fulltime was kirby mccauley now my agent had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited  my solution was to lurch into science

features prominently in two of campbells later novels ancient images and the grin of the dark\\ncampbell wrote novelisations and introductions for a series of novelisations of universal horror films the series has a rather complex publishing history they were published in paperback in 1977 in the us with uniform packaging by berkley medallion books as the universal horror library all six of the berkley editions were published under the house name carl dreadstone all six of the us editions featured stills from the relevant films it is believed this set was made available as boxed set in

not by campbell but written by other authors walter harris wrote two of the novels werewolf of london and creature from the black lagoon the author of the sixth dreadstone the mummy remains unknown uk

1983\\nthe 1980s the parasite to ancient images\\ncampbell became even more prolific during the 1980s issuing no less than eight novels of which six won awards and three short story collections he has written that after moving away from lovecrafts influence he was determined to sound like myself but also that the chicago and san francisco tales of fritz leiber were now my models in various ways i wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it and i greatly admiredstill dohow fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field and which drew some of their strength from uniting british and american influences\\nin 1981 stephen king published a semiautobiographical overview of the horror field danse macabre in a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners king devoted a section to campbells fiction alongside that of ray bradbury shirley jackson peter straub richard matheson jack finney and others on the basis of campbells earliest work especially the doll who ate his mother king argued that the authors strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers\\nin a campbell novel or story one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an lsd trip that is just ending  or just beginning the polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genres joyce carol oates  as when journeying on lsd there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things  and in the things they see  good stuff but strange so uniquely campbell that it might as well be trademarked\\nking also singled out one of campbells early short stories for particular praise the companion may be the best horror tale to be written in the english language in thirty years it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now this story appeared in campbells 1982 collection dark companions alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as early classics the chimney mackintosh willy and call first\\nthe parasite 1980 published in the us with a different ending as to wake the dead is an intense novel told from the point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices with lovecraftian undertones in the nameless 1981 also told from the point of view of a woman a child goes missing and returns only years later affiliated to a nefarious organisation obsession 1982 involves a group of childhood friends making a wish apiece concerning their futures the manifestations tormenting them in later life however as is common in campbells work involving aberrant mental states it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin in incarnate 1983 the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives the novel was written during the terrible nightmare year of campbells mothers last mental breakdown\\nin the claw 1983 originally published under the pseudonym jay ramsey and the hungry moon 1986 campbell writes more commercially than in earlier novels the latter is a multicharacter small town horror story along the lines of similar work in this period a subgenre arguably pumpprimed by the likes of stephen kings salems lot in characteristically honest and selfcritical afterwords campbell has claimed that the hungry moon along with the similarly commercial the parasite and to a lesser degree the claw are among of his least successful of his works by turns awkwardly structured containing too many ideas andor tending towards explicit violence by contrast the influence 1988 and ancient images 1989 are tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace each with predominantly female central characters and generating unease through the authors trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery in 1987 campbell published scared stiff a collection of sex and horror short stories\\nin the early 1980s campbell had crossed paths a number of time in liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young liverpool writer named clive barker who had been working around london as a playwright barker asked campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soontobepublished manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it campbell says my jaw dropped when i looked at the manuscriptit turned out to be the books of blood campbell wrote

of this decades novels won awards\\nin midnight sun 1990 an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a childrens writer in its fusion of horror with awe midnight sun shows the influence of algernon blackwood and arthur machen as well as lovecraft although the author considers this novel an honourable failure it is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career needing ghosts 1990 a novella is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it felt like dreaming on the page and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges\\na sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy the count of eleven 1991 which displays campbells gift for word play and which the author has said is disturbing because it doesnt stop being funny when you think it should a review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by stan laurel an observation that delighted campbell who is a great admirer of laurel and hardy other novels of this decade include the long lost 1993 in which a sineater is discovered by a couple holidaying in wales and brought home ostensibly as an relative with considerable impact on a community a haunted house novel called the house on nazareth hill 1996 combining the authors m r jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style is a study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes particularly those relating to the youngs quest for independence and the threat this presents to others\\ncampbell had earlier published a nonsupernatural novel called the one safe place 1995 which uses a highly charged thriller narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated by this time horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material all of which encouraged campbell to write a number of crimes novels the first the last voice they hear 1998 is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a catandmouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives although written under protest campbell came to think of the book during composition as bearing his own stamp and his next two novels were also nonsupernatural\\nin this decade campbell issued four short story collections including in 1993 the 30year career retrospective  published by campbells original publisher arkham house this volume illustrated by jeff k potter is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories campbell had published in those thirty years rather 39 tales which campbell and his editor jim turner thought representative drawing on material across his

events his characters are not always mindful of in this regard his approach is similar to that of m r james indeed campbell celebrates jamess concentrated prose choice of detail and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed campbell has described much of his own later work as comedies of paranoia as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd\\ncampbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work the vulnerability of children the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies

or breastmilk then as the baby is better able to chew small soft pieces or lumps may be included care should be taken as babies with teeth have the ability to break off pieces of food but they do not possess the back molars to grind so food can be carefully mashed or prechewed or broken into manageable pieces for their baby around 6 months of age babies may begin to feed themselves picking up food pieces with hands using the whole fist or later the pincer grasp the thumb and forefinger with help from parents\\nhomemade or commercial\\nhomemade baby food is less expensive than commercial baby foods homemade food is appropriate only when the family has a sufficient and varied diet as well as access to refrigeration and basic sanitation it is important to follow proper sanitation methods when preparing homemade baby food such as washing and rinsing vegetables or fruit as well as the cooking and packaging materials that will be used\\nhomemade food requires more preparation time than simply opening a jar or box of readytoeat commercial baby food food may need to be minced or pureed for young babies or cooked separately without the salt intense spices or sugar that the family chooses to eat avocados and bananas are foods that can be easily mashed and are high in vitamins and nutrients making them ideal starter foods for an infant 6 months in age or older\\ntypes\\nthrough the first year breastmilk or infant formula is the main source of calories and nutrients\\nbabies may be started directly on normal family food if attention is given to choking hazards this is called babyled weaning because breastmilk takes on the flavor of foods eaten by the mother these foods are especially good choices\\ntoddler foods\\nsome commercial baby food companies have expanded their lines to produce specialty foods for toddlers from the age of about 12 months to two and a half years old these include juice cereal small microwaveable meals baked goods and other foods that have been formulated and marketed for toddlers\\ngeriatric use\\nin the late 1940s gerber products company and beechnut produced special cookbooks to promote the sale of commercial baby foods for use by elderly sick or disabled people\\npicky eating\\nparents andor caregivers may perceive up to half of toddlers as being picky or faddy with the peak around 24 months adults who hold this opinion often stop offering new foods to the child after only three to five attempts rather than continuing to offer the food until the child has tasted it eight to fifteen times they may also engage in counterproductive behaviors such as offering appetitesuppressing milk or other favorite foods as an alternative or trying to force or bribe the child into eating\\nhistorical and cultural\\nbaby food varies from culture to culture in many cultures pastes of a grain and liquids are the first baby food in human history and presently with many cultures around the world babies are fed food premasticated by the caretaker of the baby in order to pulverise the food and start the digestion process an infants first bite of solid food is ceremonial and holds religious importance in many cultures an example of this is annaprashan a hindu ritual where the infant is fed a sweetened rice porridge usually blessed by an elder family member similar rites of passage are practiced across asia including the bengal region vietnam and thailand\\nin the western world until the mid1900s baby food was generally made at home the industrial revolution saw the beginning of the baby food market which promoted commercial baby foods as convenience items in developed countries babies are now often started with commercially produced ironfortified infant cereals and then move on to mashed fruits and vegetables commercial baby foods are widely available in dry readytofeed and frozen forms often in small batches eg small jars for convenience of preparation on the contrary in developing countries breastfeeding is more widely accepted and socially tolerated in public thus creating a societal contrast amy bentley author of inventing baby food talks about how infant feeding reflects ones position in the postwar era of the american century because in developed countries families are able to purchase processed baby foods to feed their children whereas in developing country natural breastfeeding is more popular\\ncommercially prepared baby foods in the netherlands were first prepared by martinus van der hagen through his nv nutricia company in 1901 in united states they were first prepared by harold clapp who sold clapps baby food in the 1920s the fremont canning company now called the gerber products company started in 1927 the beechnut company entered the us baby food market in 1931 the first precooked dried baby food was pablum which was originally made for sick children in the 1930s other commercial baby food manufacturers include h j heinz company nestl nutricia organix and unilever heinz produced dehydrated baby food in the 1980s the demand from parents for organic food began to grow in the 1960s since then many larger commercial manufacturers have introduced organic lines of infant food\\nat the beginning of the 20th century in america most babies began eating baby food around the age of seven months during and shortly after world war ii the age at which solid food was first introduced dropped to just six weeks this age has since increased to four to six months by the mid20th century manufactured baby food was readily used and supplemented previous infant feeding practices author of inventing baby food amy bentley argues that the excessive additives of sugar salt and msg in overused manufactured baby food conditioned infants to prefer processed foods later in life also it is believed that exposing infants to solid foods at an earlier age well help them get used to foods later on in life this subsequent misuse of salt and sugar was also feared to effect issues of weight and nutrition based diseases\\nin china and other east asian countries homemade baby food remains common and babies are started on rice porridge called xifan then move on to mashed fruits soft vegetables tofu and fish in sweden it is common to start with mashed fruit such as bananas as well as oatmeal and mashed vegetables in western africa maize porridge is often the first solid food given to young children\\ncontroversies\\nsome commercial baby foods have been criticized for their contents and cost\\nover the decades there have been multiple recalls of baby foods because of concerns about contamination or spoilage in 1984 and 1986 gerber was involved in a scandal over glass baby food jars breaking in transit which dramatically affected its sales and profitability although the us food and drug administration later concluded that the company was not at fault in 1987 beechnut paid us25 million to resolve charges of selling adulterated apple juice in the early 1980s in 2011 nestl france decided to recall a batch of ptit pot baby food as a precautionary measure after a customer reportedly found glass shards in one of their jars an investigation into the incidents scope led the company to conclude that it had been an isolated occurrence and that the rest of the batch had not been affected\\nmarket\\naccording to zion market research the market size for baby food in the united states is estimated to be 53 billion in 2018 and growing to 76 billion by 2021\\ncommercial baby food in the united states is dominated by gerber which had about 70 of the american market share in 1996 beechnut had about 15 of the market and heinz had about 10 heinzs earths best the largest brand of organic baby food had about 2 of the american market share\\nin australia canada and new zealand heinz had about 90 of the market share in 1996 heinz is also the market leader in the uk italy and

often flavored with soy sauce or miso and uses toppings such as  nori dried seaweed menma and scallions nearly every region in japan has its own variation of ramen such as the tonkotsu pork bone broth ramen of kyushu and the miso ramen of hokkaido mazemen is a ramen dish that is not served in a soup but rather with a sauce such as tare\\nhistory\\netymology\\nthe word ramen is a japanese borrowing of the mandarin chinese lmin  pulled noodles in 1910 the first ramen shop named   opened at asakusa tokyo where the japanese owner employed 12 cantonese cooks from yokohamas chinatown and served the ramen arranged for japanese customers until the 1950s ramen was called shina soba  literally chinese soba today chka soba  also meaning chinese soba or just ramen  are more common as the word  shina meaning china has acquired a pejorative connotation\\norigin\\nramen is a japanese adaptation of chinese wheat noodles one theory says that ramen was introduced to japan during the 1660s by the chinese neoconfucian scholar zhu shunsui who served as an advisor to tokugawa mitsukuni after he became a refugee in japan to escape manchu rule and mitsukuni became the first japanese person to eat ramen most historians reject this theory as a myth created by the japanese to embellish the origins of ramen \\naccording to historians the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to japan in the late 19th or early 20th century by chinese immigrants living in the yokohama chinatown according to the record of the yokohama ramen museum ramen originated in china and made its way to japan in 1859 early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with chinesestyle roast pork\\nby 1900 restaurants serving chinese cuisine from canton and shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles cut rather than handpulled a few toppings and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones many chinese living in japan also pulled portable food stalls selling ramen and gyza dumplings to workers by the mid1900s these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera  from the portuguese charamela to advertise their presence a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording by the early shwa period ramen had become a popular dish when eating out according to ramen expert hiroshi osaki the first specialized ramen shop opened in yokohama in 1910\\npostwar popularization\\nafter japans defeat in world war ii the american military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952 in december 1945 japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years which caused food shortages as japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in china and taiwan the us flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages from 1948 to 1951 bread consumption in japan increased from 262121 tons to 611784 tons but wheat also found its way into ramen which most japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule although the americans maintained japans wartime ban on outdoor food vending flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters locally referred to as yakuza who extorted vendors for protection money thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation \\nin the same period millions of japanese troops returned from china and continental east asia from their posts in the second sinojapanese war some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles by 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened which further boosted the number of ramen vendors private companies even rented out yatai starter kits consisting of noodles toppings bowls and chopsticks ramen yatai provided a rare opportunity for small scale postwar entrepreneurship the americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein the combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in japans ricebased culture gradually ramen became associated with urban life\\nmodern period\\nin 1958 instant noodles were invented by momofuku ando the taiwanesejapanese founder and chairman of nissin foods named the greatest japanese invention of the 20th century in a japanese poll instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water\\nbeginning in the 1980s ramen became a japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world at the same time local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names a ramen museum opened in yokohama in 1994\\ntoday ramen is one of japans most popular foods with tokyo alone containing around 5000 ramen shops and more than 24000 ramen shops across japan tsuta a ramen restaurant in tokyos sugamo district received a

narrow and seat customers closely making social distancing difficult\\ntypes\\na wide variety of ramen exists in japan with geographical and vendorspecific differences even in varieties that share the same name although ramen usually has toppings ramen can be broadly categorized by its two main ingredients noodles and broth\\nnoodles\\nmost noodles are made from four basic ingredients wheat flour salt water and from  a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid although ramen noodles and udon noodles are both made with wheat and are similar they are different kinds of noodle\\nthe kansui is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles and originated in inner mongolia where some lakes contain large amounts of these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these noodles making noodles with kansui lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture eggs may also be substituted for kansui some noodles are made with neither eggs nor kansui and should only be used for yakisoba as they have a weaker structure and are more prone to soaking up moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup\\nramen comes in various shapes and lengths it may be thick thin or even ribbonlike as well as straight or wrinkled\\ntraditionally ramen noodles were made by hand but with growing popularity many ramen restaurants prefer to use noodlemaking machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality automatic ramenmaking machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid 20th century produced by such japanese manufacturers as yamato mfg and others\\nsoup\\nramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork combined with a variety of ingredients such as pork bones katsuobushi skipjack tuna flakes niboshi dried baby sardines beef bones shiitake onions and kombu kelp some modern ramen broths can also be vegetablebased tare is often added to broth to make the soup\\nflavors\\nthe resulting combination is generally divided into several categories although newer and older variations often make this categorization less clearcut a description of said old variations are as follows\\ntoppings\\nafter basic preparation ramen can be seasoned and flavored with any number of toppings including but not limited to\\npreference\\nseasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper black pepper butter chili pepper sesame seeds and crushed garlic soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets\\nmost tonkotsu ramen restaurants offer a system known as kaedama  where customers who have finished their noodles can request a refill for a few hundred yen more to be put into their remaining soup\\nregional variations\\nwhile standard versions of ramen are available throughout japan since the taish period the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations some of these which have gone on to national prominence are\\nrelated dishes\\nthere are many related chineseinfluenced noodle dishes in japan the following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments they do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally japanese such as soba or udon which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen\\nrestaurants in japan\\nramen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops izakaya drinking establishments lunch cafeterias karaoke halls and amusement parks many ramen restaurants only have a counter and a chef in these shops the meals are paid for in advance at a ticket machine to streamline the process\\nhowever the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist ramenya restaurants some restaurants also provide halalramen using chicken in osaka and kyoto as ramenya restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes they tend to lack variety in the menu besides ramen some of the dishes generally available in a ramenya restaurant include other dishes from japanese chinese cuisine such as fried rice called chahan or yakimeshi gyoza chinese dumplings and beer ramenya interiors are often filled with chineseinspired decorations\\noutside japan\\nramen became popular in china hong kong and taiwan where it is known as rsh lmin  lit japanesestyle lamian restaurant chains serve ramen alongside distinctly japanese dishes such as tempura and yakitori interestingly in japan these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen but gyoza karaage and others from japanese chinese cuisine\\nin korea ramen is called ramyeon  there are different varieties such as kimchiflavored ramyeon while usually served with vegetables such as carrots and scallions or eggs some restaurants serve variations of ramyeon containing additional ingredients such as dumplings tteok or cheese as topping\\noutside of asia particularly in areas with a large demand for asian cuisine there are restaurants specializing in japanesestyle foods such as ramen noodles for example wagamama a ukbased restaurant chain serving panasian food serves a ramen noodle soup in the united states and canada jinya ramen bar serves tonkotsu ramen\\ninstant ramen\\ninstant ramen noodles were exported from japan by nissin foods starting in 1971 bearing the name oodles of noodles one year later it was rebranded nissin cup noodles packaged in a foam food container it is referred to as cup ramen in japan and subsequently saw a growth in international sales over time the term ramen became used in north america to refer to other instant noodles while some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions including diabetes and stroke especially in women those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor instant ramen

in the hungarianspeaking regions of romania more predominantly the szkely land it became popular in both romania and hungary the first written record dates back to 1679 and was found in the village of zdiszentpter now snpetru de cmpie while the first recipe appears in a manuscript cookbook dated in 1781 earlier a festive treat now it is part of everyday consumption in transylvania a similar pastry to krtskalcs is baumstriezel originating from the saxon communities\\nkrtskalcs is made from sweet yeast dough raised dough of which a strip is spun and then wrapped around a truncated coneshaped baking spit and rolled in granulated sugar it is roasted over charcoal while basted with melted butter until its surface cooks to a goldenbrown color during the baking process the sugar stuck on the caramelises and forms a shiny crispy crust the surface of the cake can then be topped with additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon\\netymology\\nthe name refers to a stovepipe  since the fresh steaming cake in the shape of a truncated cone resembles a hot chimney\\nthis opinion is shared by  scholar and philologist from clujnapoca when taken off from the spit in one piece the cake assumes the shape of a long vent or tube since the cake is served in this tubular form to family and guests and consumers are faced with this typical ventlike image of the dough to be torn off in strips it is selfevident that its name must have been given with regard to the vent shape of the cake\\nthroughout the centuries miscellaneous alternate names and spellings of krtskalcs have been used more references were mentioned even in the 19th century eg spitdonut or stick roll or stickdonut the name krtskalcs originated in transylvania and became popular only by the middle of the 20th century until the end of the century it had different spellings eg spelt with  as in horn cake or in two words as in  the present variant krtskalcs was first used in print in a cookbook published in 1926 by the book department of brassi lapok a newspaper from braov\\nmeasures to have krtskalcs registered in the european union as a protected designation of origin pdo product have been taken\\nhistory\\nthe first known record that hints at a family of cakes baked by rotating spit over cinders dates back to medieval times about 1450 and is found in a manuscript from heidelberg the description mentions a strip of raised dough that has to be wound in a helix shape around a baking spit and brushed with egg yolk before baking\\nin the 16th century the evolution of the cake family proceeded in three branches the first branch contains pastries that preserved the image of cake similar to the one mentioned above with a strip wound on spit in a helical shape the szeklerhungarian krtskalcs skalicky trdelnik trdelnk from skalica and the czechmoravian trdlotrdelnicetrdelnik which is virtually the same as the latter as well as the krtsfnk krtsh donut belong to this branch the second branch has pastries made from batter namely the lithuanian raguolis and akotis polish skacz the french gateau a la broche the german baumkuchen the austrian prgertorte and prgelkrapfen as well as the swedish spettekaka the third branch is represented by one cake the transylvaniansaxon baumstriezel where a continuous dough strip is placed on a spit\\nthe first known recipe of krtskalcs originates from transylvania included in the 1784 cookbook of countess mria mikes of zabola krts kalts  la mrs porni it makes no mention however of sweetening of any kind in the preparation a recipe from the cookbook written by kristf simai in 1795 in upper hungary presentday slovakia first mentioned sweetening subsequent to baking trdelnik from skalica is based on similar preparation with the cake surface covered in chopped nuts eg walnut almond before baking and sugar that is added only subsequent to baking\\nalmost 100 years passed before the first mention was made of the next step in the evolution of krtskalcs the appearance of a caramelized sugar glaze in aunt rzis cookbook written by terzia dolecsk in 1876 published in szeged hungary the recipe suggests sprinkling sugar sugar almond on dough on spit a priory to baking due to the heat the sugar is caramelized and also enters in what is known as maillard reaction the sugar glaze that melts to become caramel forms a continuous coat also adds to firmness of cake shortly afterwards pure sugar not almond sugar was applied to the doughs surface before baking even with the omission of sweetening subsequent to baking gnes zilahis cookbook entitled valdi magyar szakcsknyv the real hungarian cookbook which appeared in budapest in 1892 presents such a recipe\\nthe first mention of additional toppings applied to the caramel glaze appears in rzi nni szakcsknyve aunt rzis cookbook the use of ground chopped or candied walnuts applied as an additional topping became popular only in the late 20th century as far as we know pl kvis cookbook erdlyi lakoma transylvanian feast which came out in 1980 seems to be the first source with the tip of applying this type of topping the wide spectrum of cinnamon coconut cocoa etc toppings started to receive wide application only at the end of the century\\nthe current most frequently baked variant of krtskalcs evolved in szeklerland in the first half of the 20th century it is specific to this variant that the surface of the raw dough wrapped around the spit flattens out by the usual procedure of rolling it on a flat surface sprinkled with granulated sugar by this procedure the layers of dough wrapped around the spit are pressed together rendering the cake smoother more compact in structure and more elegant the first written record of this technique appears in the cookbook of mrs zathureczky ne manci zlech which was published in bart between 1934 and 1943 the cookbook entitled erdlyi zek flavors of transylvania which appeared in miercureaciuc published in 2007 gives a recipe of this sort\\nspread\\nkrtskalcs became popular among the hungarian nobility at the beginning of the 18th century one hint at an austrian or german origin is the fact that a conservative transylvanian nobleman pter apor in his work metamorphosis transylvaniae does not mention krtskalcs in the list of traditional hungarian foods for all the evidence we have about the cake already existing in his wifes cuisine in a letter from a mother superior in moldavia addressed to mrs pter apor ne borbla klnoki the writer asks mrs apor to have a butler of hers taught the art of baking krtslalcs honored mother superior prays you if she could send you a butler in the hope perchance you spare no pain and teach him kindly some art of baking krtslalcs withal others\\nby the end of the 18th century krtskalcs had become popular in all hungarian speaking regions as a defining element of both urban and rustic cuisine in the first volume of a szkelyfld lersa description of the szeklerland from 1868 balzs orbn writes about the genesis legend of udvarhelyszk which holds that the szeklers chased into caves and later blockaded by the tatars eventually made the enemy leave by presenting them a huge krtskalcs made of straw which they held out of the cave to show they had supplies to endure the siege throughout the 19th and 20th centuries the recipe of the cake was recorded in numerous popular cookbooks\\nas a result of urbanization at the beginning of the 20th century krtskalcs was replaced by newer cakes but on the eastern periphery of the hungarian speaking regions in the szeklerland the open fireplace survived to the end of the 19th century and consequently krtskalcs has been preserved as a living tradition on regions dwelt by szeklers up to the present krtskalcs baked above cinders is regarded as essential to the transylvanian wedding menu\\nfollowing the change of regime in 1989 krtskalcs became the traditional local treat offered to hungarian tourists visiting szekler villages and thus an element of the international image of both the szeklerland and transylvania this gastronomic tradition which earlier had been preserved merely in rural szekler communities gradually found its way back to the culture of the hungarian elite mainly due to tourism by the middle of the 1990s krtskalcs became popular in most cities in hungary and tourists visiting hungary reported on the gorgeous sweet tubular treat with admiration\\nbecause of international migrations and tourism however krtskalcs is also no longer regarded as a solely szekler or hungarian symbol but rather as representative of european gastronomy\\nvariants\\nthree variants of krtskalcs can be distinguished which are nonetheless manufactured in a similar way\\nthe recipe of the traditional homemade variant became standardized at the beginning of the 20th century the ingredients are firmly specified and it is usually baked above cinders the essential ingredients are exclusively sugar wheat flour butter milk eggs yeast and salt additional toppings are restricted to ground or chopped walnut almond cinnamon powder or vanilla sugar made from natural vanilla powder\\nvariants at carnivals became popular in the late 20th century with this variant the recipe is more flexible so that it can be manufactured in smaller mobile places rendering it much cheaper in this variant butter can be replaced by vegetable oil or margarine and milk by milk powder moreover eggs can be replaced by egg powder or liquid eggs but this ingredient can also be omitted in exchange grated lemon zest natural citrus extract or citrus juice rum or vanilla sugar powder can be added to the dough the surface can be provided any additional topping that bears flavor and aroma\\nfurther alternative variants appeared at the beginning of the 21st century these recipes can be even more flexible the dough can be made of nonwheat flour the inner tubular part can be also given an additional coating and it can abound in other natural ingredients eg pieces of fruit alternative krtskalcs can be prepared gluten free as well a cake that lacks ingredients of animal origin milk butter eggs can be labeled as vegan or lent\\nkrtsfnk krtsh donut is a similarshaped cake which is baked in oil or fat and topped with sugar after baking or stuffed with whipped cream\\nbaking process\\nkrtskalcs is made of a relatively hard and dry yeastdough a twine of dough is wrapped around the length of the spit and then the spit with the strip of dough on it is rolled in sugar before or during baking its brushed with melted butter the cake is ready when its surface has an even brownishred color strictly homemade krtskalcs can be made exclusively from natural ingredients flour sugar milk butter eggs yeast and salt for other variants of all ingredients it is merely margarine and vanilla sugar powder that can be synthetic including ingredients of the final topping\\nkrtskalcs can be enriched by further aromas and flavors if the completed cake is provided a final topping any topping can be used\\nthat does not contain salt cheese meat or other nonconfectionery ingredients\\namong pastries that are most closely related to krtskalcs the transylvanian saxon baumstriezel has a cylinder shape rather than a helix skalicky trdelnik from slovakia formerly upper hungary as well as trdlotrdelnicetrdelnik from the czechmoravian region differ from krtskalcs in that there is no caramel sugar glaze applied to their surface\\nforeign names\\nneighboring nations have their own names for the cake amongst saxons who earlier dwelt in transylvania the literal translation of the word krtskalcs or schornsteinkuchen became popular poles and romanians use both the phonetic transcription of the word krtskalcs and the translation of the adjective  noun cluster of magyar kalcs or szkely kalcs kurtoszkalacz or wegierski kolacz and respectively colac secuiesc or cozonac secuiesc other versions use either a phonetic transcription of the entire compound word kurtosh kalach or a phonetic transcription of the clusters first element such as kurtosh for krts

for folding the skin includes putting a single pleat in the middle putting multiple pleats along the edge making a wavy edge like a pie crust turning a pleated edge in toward the body resulting in a rounded edge and putting both ends together resulting in a round shape different shapes of jiaozi require different folding techniques but the most famous and common technique is the pinchededge fold take a wrapper and put one tablespoon of filling into the center of the wrapper fold a half of edge to the other half use left thumb and forefinger to pinch one side of the halfmoon wrapper and then use right thumb to push the inside skin outward right forefinger to make outside skin into small pleats use right thumb to clench those pleats repeat these steps to the other side of the wrapper and make sure to clench the seal of jiaozi this is crescentshaped jiaozi the most popular shape in china\\nvariations\\nguangdong\\njiaozi is called gaau ji in cantonese and are standard fare in guangdong style dim sum the immediate noted difference to northern style is that they are smaller and wrapped in a thinner translucent skin and usually steamed the smaller size and the thinner wrapper make the dumplings easier to cook through with steaming in contrast to jiaozi guangdong gaau ji are rarely homemade because the wrapper which needs to be thin but tough enough to not break is more difficult to make many types of fillings exist with the most common type being har gow  but fillings can include scallop chicken tofu and mixed vegetables dim sum restaurants often feature their own house specials or innovations dim sum chefs and artists often use ingredients in new or creative ways or draw inspiration from other chinese culinary traditions such as chaozhou hakka or shanghai more creative chefs may even create fusion gaau ji by using elements from other cultures such as japanese teriyaki or southeast asian satay or curry while upscale restaurants may use expensive or exotic ingredients such as lobster shark fin and birds nest\\nanother cantonese dumpling is yau gok  which are made with glutinous rice dough and deep fried\\nguotie\\nguotie  are a northern chinese style dumpling popular as a street food appetizer or side order in chinese cuisine guotie differs from pan fried dumplings or jianjiao in that the shape of guotie is usually elongated and the two ends are often left open guotie is sometimes served on a dim sum menu but may be offered independently the filling for both guotie and jianjiao usually contains pork sometimes chicken or beef in muslim areas cabbage or chinese cabbage and sometimes spinach scallions spring or green onions ginger chinese rice wine or cooking wine and sesame seed oil in southern china the term guotie is often used as a synonym for the typical jianjiao rather than referring to a particular variety of it\\ngyza\\nthe japanese word gyza was derived from the jilu mandarin reading of  gioze and the japanese word is often written using the same chinese characters following the second world war japanese soldiers returning from the japanesebacked puppet state of manchukuo in northeastern china brought home gyza recipes\\nthe prevalent differences between japanesestyle gyza and chinesestyle jiaozi are the rich garlic flavor which is less noticeable in the chinese version and that gyza wrappers tend to be thinner due to the fact that most japanese restaurants use machinemade wrappers in contrast the rustic cuisine of poor chinese immigrants shaped westerners views that chinese restaurant jiaozi use thicker handmade wrappers as jiaozi vary greatly across regions within china these differences are not as clear in the country of origin for example visitors will easily find thinskinned jiaozi at restaurants in shanghai and at street food vendors in the hangzhou region gyza wrappers are actually identical to jiaozi wrappers seen in chinese households using storebought machinemade wrappers gyza are usually served with soybased tare sauce seasoned with rice vinegar andor chili oil ryu in japanese lyu  in mandarin chinese the most common recipe is a mixture of minced pork sometimes chicken or beef cabbage asian chives and sesame oil andor garlic andor ginger which is then wrapped in the thinly rolled dough skins gyoza share similarities with both pierogi and spring rolls and are cooked in the same fashion as pierogi either boiled or fried\\ngyza and gyza wrappers can be found in supermarkets and restaurants throughout japan either frozen or ready to eat panfried gyza are sold as a side dish in many ramen and chinese restaurants both the wrappers and the prepared gyza themselves are increasingly easy to find in asian markets around the world\\nthe most popular preparation method is the panfried style called yakigyza  in which the dumpling is first fried on one flat side creating a crispy skin then water is added and the pan sealed with a lid until the upper part of the dumpling is steamed this technique is what the chinese call guotie or potstickers see above other popular methods include boiling suigyza  and deep frying agegyza \\nstorebought frozen dumplings are often prepared at home by first placing them in a pot of water bringing it to a boil and then transferring them to a pan with oil to fry the skin\\nmomo\\nthe tibetan and nepalese version is known as momo tibetan  nepali  the word momo comes from a chinese loanword momo  which translates to steamed bread when preparing momo flour is filled most commonly with ground water buffalo meat often ground lamb or chicken meat is used as alternate to water buffalo meat in nepal there is also a vegetarian option where mixtures of potato cheese and other vegetable items are mixed finely chopped onion minced garlic fresh minced ginger cumin powder salt coriandercilantro etc are added to the meat for flavouring a sauce made from cooked tomatoes flavored with sichuan pepper and minced red chilies is often served along with momo\\nthe nepalese momo is usually served with dipping sauces that include tomato based chutneys or sesame based sauces sauces can be thick or thin consistency depending on the eatery locally called chutneyachhar that is normally made with tomato as the base ingredient in kathmandu valley the traditional way of serving momo momocha is 10 pingpong ball sized round momo drowned in a tangy tomatoey and nutty broth  sauce called jhol watery soup  broth in nepali achar served at room temperature with watery  runny consistency also known as kathmandu style momo jhol momo in the other hand has warmedup  hot broth poured over momo not cooked in the soup  broth to make the jhol achar one of the main ingredients is nepali hog plum lapsi but if unavailable lemon  lime juice can be used\\njiaozi and wonton\\njiaozi should not be confused with wonton jiaozi have a thicker skin and a relatively flatter more oblate doublesaucer like shape and are usually eaten with a soyvinegar dipping sauce andor hot chili sauce while wontons have thinner skin and are usually served in broth the dough for the jiaozi and wonton wrappers also consist of different ingredients'}, {'title': 'Pea_protein', 'label': 'Food', 'text': ' \\npea protein is a type of food it is a source of protein derived and extracted in powder from the yellow and green split peas pisum sativum classified in the legume food group it can be used as a supplement to increase an individuals protein or other nutrient intake or as a substitute for other food products eg the substitution of dairy milk by pea milk it is also used as a functional ingredient in foodmanufacturing such as a thickener foaming agent or an emulsifier\\nit is extracted in a powder form and can be processed and produced in different ways\\npea protein is a beneficial food source due to its low allergenicity availability and high nutritional value it can also help increase muscle mass contribute to weightloss and it is a more environmentally friendly source of protein\\npea protein is criticized for its effects on digestion taste and high sodium content depending on the method of processing pea protein can contain certain levels of trypsin inhibitors phytates and lectins which can cause negative side effects such as reduced nutrient uptake and intestinal damage\\ncomposition\\npea protein is rich in nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates pea protein also contains various important vitamins and minerals and is low in fat while generally rich in protein the actual protein content of peas is not always consistent\\xa0 it is variable and influenced by both genetic factors and environmental factors such as soil and climate in which the peas are cultivated\\npea protein contains all essential amino acids to meet human dietary needs\\ntypically peas contain 231309 protein1520 fat and minor constituents such as vitamins phytic acid saponins polyphenols minerals and oxalates they also contain several classes of protein globulin albumin prolamin and glutelin the proteins are mainly albumins and globulins which account for 1020 and 7080 of the protein in the pea seed respectively the albumins are water soluble and considered the metabolic and enzymatic proteins while the globulins are salt soluble and act as the storage proteins for the seed globulins can be further classified into legumin and vicilin which belong to the 11s and 7s seed storage protein classes respectively legumin is a hexameric protein and vicilin proteins are trimers\\npea seeds contain 6065 carbohydrates mainly composed of oligosaccharides monosaccharides polysaccharides and disaccharides the major carbohydrate fraction in peas is starch which is the major storage carbohydrate in the cotyledons\\npeas also contain high levels of dietary fibre which consists of cellulose gums hemicellulose pectin mucilage lignin and resistant starches dry pea has 1727 dietary fibre depending on their cultivar environment and global growing region\\nin terms of sugars pea seeds contain 56 sucrose and raffinose sucrose ranges from 22 to 26 whereas oligosaccharides such as stachyose have a range of 1332 verbascose 1240 and raffinose 0210 depending on cultivar and environment the fat content of pea seeds ranges from 12 to 18 depending on the cultivar and about 25 of fatty acids are composed of oleic acid 181 and 50 of linoleic acid 182\\npea seeds are also a rich source of minerals and vitamins they contain high levels of the following\\nin addition peas are a rich source of folic acid riboflavin pyridoxine niacin pyridoxamine and pyridoxal\\nuses\\ndietary supplement\\nthe nutritional qualities contained in pea proteins can be used to supplement people with certain deficiencies or people seeking to enrich their diet with nutrients peas are an excellent source of proteins carbohydrates dietary fibre minerals vitamins and phytochemicals for example pea protein can balance iron intake as it is high in iron in general they contain over five milligrams per serve a quarter of the recommended daily iron intake for adults\\ndietary substitute\\npea protein can be used as a protein substitute for those who cannot consume other sources as it is not derived from any of the most common allergenic foods wheat peanuts eggs soy fish shellfish tree nuts and milk it may be used in baked goods or other cooking applications to replace common allergens it is also processed industrially to form food products and alternative proteins such as alternative meat products and nondairy products manufacturers of alternatives include ripple foods who produce a dairy alternative pea milk pea protein is also used in meatalternatives such as gardein and beyond meat and egg alternatives such as just mayo\\nfunctional ingredient\\npea protein is also used as a lowcost functional ingredient in food manufacturing to improve the nutritional value and texture of food products they can also optimize the viscosity emulsification gelation stability or fatbinding properties of food for example the capacity of pea protein to form stable foams is an important property in cakes souffles whipped toppings fudges etc\\nproduction\\nthe manufacturing process of pea protein concentrates and isolates consists of protein extraction purification and drying the industrial production of pea protein begins with the steps of cleaning and splitting the pea crop and then processing them further\\nthe cleaning process cleaning uses equipment such as indent cleaners which are used to remove impurities this process ensures that any allergens such as wheat barley and other seeds are removed as these products contain gluten if not removed it would affect its classification as a glutenfree product\\nthe splitting process following cleaning the pea is split and dehulled using a dehuller the dehullers are a device that splits the pea seed and extracts the part of the whole seed which is the hull\\nfurther processing following the splitting process the split peas are further processed either into starch protein and flour fractions\\npea protein can be produced using two methods\\nwet fractionation method\\nthe wet fractionation method is used to produce pea protein isolates pea protein isolates generally contain a higher concentration of protein than pea protein concentrates it involves the extraction of the protein at an alkaline ph an alkaline ph is usually between ph 95105 during the extraction of the protein it is dispersed in water so that other components of the pea such as carbohydrates are also extracted via ultrafiltration or isoelectric precipitation isoelectric precipitation is where the dissolved proteins are precipitated out of the aqueous phase and separated in a decanter this stage occurs at a ph of 4050 the protein is separated from the byproducts in a hydroclone the precipitated protein curd is separated from the supernatant whey by filtration or centrifugation the curd must be washed in order to remove residues of whey solubles subsequently the ph is neutralised and readjusted to 7 and a dry protein isolate is obtained with a final mechanical drying step called spraydrying\\ndry fractionation method\\nthe dry fractionation method is used to produce pea protein concentrates it \\xa0involves dry milling technology a traditional mechanical process used to reduce the particle size of split or whole peas into coarse or fine flours the outer shell of the pea is first dehulled which is then milled via impact or jet milling to produce a flour this process relies on differential particle size and density within the milled flour once milled air classification is used to separate the smaller proteinrich fragments from larger starchrich granules or fibrerich particles during this process an air flow fluidizes the milled flour in a separation chamber a classifier wheel submerged in the bed selects the small particles and allows these to form the fine fraction larger particles are rejected by the classifier wheel leave the chamber at the bottom and make up the coarse fraction dry fractionation is a more sustainable method of processing as it does not require the use of water and energy is not required to dry the protein\\nbenefits\\nhealth\\nthe health benefits derived from pea protein are mainly from the concentration and properties of starch protein fibre vitamins minerals and phytochemicals in peas\\npea protein is high in fibre which aids in mediating glycaemic response and is able to help prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce blood pressure by decreasing the levels of cholesterol and postbrandial triglyceride in humans studies have found the intake of pea protein to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive rats and humans it can also be used for the prevention and control of diabetes as it has minimal effect on blood glucose levels and insulin response due to its high fibre content pea protein has a 94 rate of digestibility which minimises stomach and gastrointestinal digestion issues such as flatulence and discomfort from bloating its starch content also aids digestibility as it is attributed to the nonavailability to amylases of starch granules enclosed in intact cell wall structures the presence of antinutrients such as amylase inhibitors phytates and phenolics\\npea proteins also contain high levels of folate this can help increase dietary folate levels which is beneficial for people with anaemia and neural tube defects it also contains phenolic compounds which are natural antioxidants that may help protect against diseases such as cancer and various inflammatoryrelated diseases\\nthe amino acid profile of pea protein is also beneficial it is high in lysine which helps to convert fatty acids into energy and is important for the health of connective tissue it is a great source of arginine which promotes healthy blood flow and heart health as well as leucine isoleucine and valine which promote muscle growth\\nmuscle mass\\npea protein can be used as a protein supplement to increase muscle mass increasing protein intake creates a positive acute postprandial muscle protein synthesis response and may create a positive longterm improvement in lean mass pea proteins also contain branchedchain amino acids bcaas leucine isoleucine and valine which helps to promote muscle growth\\none study involving a 12week experiment on protein supplementation before and after resistance training found that the consumption of pea protein promoted an increase in muscle mass specifically in biceps brachii thickness\\nweight loss\\npea proteins are also beneficial for weight loss pea proteins digest more slowly which has a satiating effect and reduces hunger which can contribute to weight loss the appetitesuppressing effects of peas may be related to high amounts of protein and dietary fibre which may delay gastric emptying attenuate glucose absorption and concentration and stimulate the release of appetiteregulating hormones\\nenvironmental impact\\nwhen compared to the extraction of other proteins such as whey and soy the production of pea protein utilises fewer resources which can impact the environment such as the use of water and fertilizers pea proteins require less water in their production and extraction process making pea proteins a more environmentally sustainable food source than its counterparts one study found that one kilogram of animal protein can only be obtained by feeding six kilograms of plant protein another study found that the water footprint per gram of protein for eggs chicken meat and milk is 15 times larger than for peas in the case of beef the water footprint per gram of protein is six times larger than for peas\\ncriticisms\\ntaste\\npea proteins have also been criticised for their taste as they contain a compound called saponins which can produce a bitter and metallic taste\\ntexture\\ndepending on the method of processing pea protein can have a gritty texture\\ncomposition\\ndepending on the method of processing some pea proteins can contain high levels of antinutritional properties such as phytates lectins and trypsin inhibitors which have negative side effects saponins and phytates may exhibit hypocholesterolaemic and anticarcinogenic activities trypsin inhibitors decrease the digestion of the protein lectins can impede the uptake of glucose decrease nutrient transport and create damage to the mucosal layer of the intestines by binding to carbohydrate molecules phytates affect the bioavailability and digestibility of the protein by forming complexes with essential dietary minerals such as iron zinc and calcium affecting their absorption'}, {'title': 'Ketupat', 'label': 'Food', 'text': 'ketupat in indonesian and malay kupat in javanese and sundanese or tipat in balinese is a javanese rice cake packed inside a diamondshaped

maritime southeast asia from java indonesia to malaysia singapore and the philippines ketupat is made from rice that has been wrapped in a woven palm leaf pouch and boiled as the rice cooks the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed this method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture of a rice cake \\nketupat was first introduced by an indonesian theologian named sunan kalijaga who was an important figure for muslims in java in java and most of indonesia ketupat is linked to islamic tradition of lebaran eid ulfitr the earliest connection of ketupat with islamic lebaran tradition is believed to be originated in 15thcentury sultanate of demak\\naccording to javanese traditions the indonesian lebaran tradition was first started when sunan bonang one of wali songo of tuban in 15thcentury java calls for the muslims to elevate the perfection of their ramadhan fast by asking forgiveness and forgiving others wrongdoings the tradition on preparing and consuming ketupat or kupat in javanese language during lebaran was introduced by raden mas sahid or sunan kalijaga one of wali songo nine muslim saints that spread islam in java sunan kalijaga introduced the lebaran ketupat ritual on 8 shawwal a week after eid ulfitr and a day after a sixday shawwal fast it is believed that it contains appropriate symbolism kupat means ngaku lepat or admitting ones mistakes in javanese language in accordance to asking for forgiveness tradition during lebaran the crossed weaving of palm leaves symbolises mistakes and sins committed by human beings and the inner whitish rice cake symbolise purity and deliverance from sins after observing ramadhan fast prayer and rituals \\nother than java the tradition on consuming ketupat during eid ulfitr is also can be found throughout indonesia from sumatra kalimantan sulawesi nusa tenggara and also neighboring countries including malaysia singapore and brunei ketupat has also been used as sajen an offering for dead ancestors for centuries people hang a bunch of ketupat usually banten style at the door to treat the spirit of the ancestors they believe would come back to visit \\nlocal stories passed down through the generations have attributed the creation of this style of rice preparation to the seafarers need to keep cooked rice from spoiling during long sea voyages the coco leaves used in wrapping the rice are always shaped into a triangular or diamond form and stored hanging in bunches in the open air the shape of the package facilitates moisture to drip away from the cooked rice while the coco leaves allow the rice to be aerated and at the same time prevent flies and insects from touching it\\ndespite its current association with muslim festival of lebaran ketupat is also known in nonmuslim communities such as hindu balinese and people of the philippines which suggested that the weaving of coconut fronds has preislamic origin it was linked to the local hindu ritual on venerating dewi sri the javanese goddess of rice the balinese hindus still weaved the cili fronds effigy of dewi sri as an offering as well as weaving tipat fronds during kuningan balinese hindu holy day\\ncultural significance\\nin various places in indonesia there is a ceremony called lebaran ketupat which is observed after the conclusion of an extra six days of fasting following idul fitri in lombok west nusa tenggara thousands of muslims celebrated lebaran ketupator lebaran topat as it is locally calledby visiting the graves of muslim ulamas before partaking in communal

to celebrate kuningan balinese hindu families make tipat or ketupat first as offering and then they consume some ketupat afterwards\\nthere are some striking similarities between javanese muslim lebaran and balinese hindu galungankuningan holy days of which ketupat is one for example the families pay a visit to the grave of their family or ancestors prior of observing the holy day and they consume ketupat to conclude the religious festival although today in contemporary indonesia ketupat is strongly associated with muslim celebration of idul fitri this parallel phenomenon suggested the preislamic native origin of ketupat as native indonesian ways to shows gratitude and to celebrate festivities by making and consuming certain kind of food\\nvarieties\\nthere are many varieties of ketupat with two of the more common ones being ketupat nasi and ketupat pulut ketupat nasi is made from common white rice and is wrapped in a square shape with coconut palm leaves while ketupat pulut is made from glutinous rice is usually wrapped in a triangular shape using the leaves of the fan palm licuala ketupat pulut is also called ketupat daun palas in malaysia primarily found in northern malay peninsula and among the malay community of southern thailand usually ketupat pouch are made from janur or young palm leaves fronds however in kalimantan nipah leaves might be used and woven into

form in california cuisine consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients the tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it make it more pliable and allow it to adhere to itself burritos are often eaten by hand as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together burritos can also be served wet ie covered in a savory and spicy sauce when they would be eaten with a fork and knife\\nburritos are filled with savory ingredients most often a meat such as beef chicken or pork and often include other ingredients such as rice cooked beans either whole or refried vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes cheese and condiments such as salsa pico de gallo guacamole or crema\\nburritos are often contrasted with similar dishes such as tacos in which a small handsized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed or with enchiladas which use corn masa tortillas and are covered in a savory sauce to be eaten with a fork and knife\\netymology\\nthe word burrito means little donkey in spanish the diminutive form of burro or donkey the name burrito as applied to the dish possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a large burden\\nhistory\\nbefore the development of the modern burrito the maya civilization of mexico used corn tortillas as early as 1500 bc to wrap foods with fillings of chili peppers tomatoes mushrooms squash and avocados historically the pueblo peoples of the southwestern us also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito but these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco rather than the modern burrito\\nthe precise origin of the modern burrito is not known in the 1895 by feliz ramos i duarte the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the mexican state of guanajuato and defined as  a rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside called  in yucatn and  in the city of cuernavaca and in mexico city some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros the cowboys of northern mexico in the 19th century\\nan often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named juan mndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the bella vista neighborhood of ciudad jurez during the mexican revolution period 19101921 while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food to keep the food warm mndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth as the food of the burrito ie food of the little donkey grew in popularity burrito was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos\\nanother origin story tells of ciudad jurez in the 1940s where a street food vendor created the tortillawrapped food to sell to poor children at a staterun middle school the vendor would call the children his burritos because

had expanded to a chain of 60 taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality hoping to draw on the prestige of robertos new taco shops in san diego began using the bertos suffix with names like albertos filibertos hilbertos and others\\nthe california burrito originated at an unknown bertos named restaurant in san diego in the 1980s the fresh mxn chain formerly santanas also claimed to be the originator of the california burrito the earliestknown published mention was in a 1995 article in the albuquerque tribune the california burrito typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat french fries cheese and either cilantro pico de gallo sour cream onion or guacamole or some combination of these five the ingredients are similar to those used in the carne asada fries dish and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of san diego with the merging of french fries and more traditional burrito fillings the california burrito is an example of fusion border food the california burrito has also been described as a transclass food item as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines variants of this burrito may add shrimp surf and turf or substitute carnitas pork or chicken for carne asada\\nthe is considered one of the regional foods of san diego carolynn carreno has said that to san diegans carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of pizza pie is to a new yorker the san diegostyle carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada guacamole and pico de gallo salsa this walltowall use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients\\nlos angeles\\nlos angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties the first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at mexicanamerican restaurants such as al amp beas lupes 2 and burrito king these restaurants have often been in existence for decades and they offer a distinctly americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria the burrito of la itself can take multiple forms but is almost always dominated by some combination of refried beans meat often stewed beef or chili and cheese usually cheddar with rice and other ingredients typical of mission burritos offered as addons if at all\\nthe most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese beyond this there are the green chile and red chile burritos which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans as at al amp beas meat or cheese as well rice again is rarely included which along with the choice of chiles is one of the styles most defining traits the menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations such as beef and bean allbeef a special with further ingredients etc if the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches it may sell a burrito version of these such as a hot dog burrito\\nin addition to the version described los angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of mexican fusion cuisine the first is the famed kosher burrito served since 1946 at its eponymous restaurant at 1st street and main in downtown los angeles another is the korean kogi burrito invented by american chef roy choi the first to combine mexican and korean cuisines the kogi burrito was named the seventh best burrito in los angeles in 2012 by the la weekly the kogi burrito is accented with chilesoy vinaigrette sesame oil and fresh lime juice food writer cathy chaplin has said that this is what los angeles tastes like finally there is the sushi burrito most notably the version sold at the jogasaki food truck wrapped in flour tortillas sushi burritos include such fillings as spicy tuna tempura and cucumber\\nthe existence of such a large truly mexican community in los angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of mexico from oaxaca to hidalgo\\nresearch\\ntaco bell research chef anne albertine experimented with grilling burritos to enhance portability this grilling technique allowed large burritos to remain sealed without spilling their contents this is a wellknown cooking technique used by some san francisco taquerias and northern mexican burrito stands traditionally grilled burritos are cooked on a comal griddle\\nbean burritos which are high in protein and low in saturated fat have been touted for their health benefits black bean burritos are also a good source of dietary fiber and

marzipan they are not necessarily contradictory and may be complementary as there have always been mediterranean trade and cooking influences other sources establish the origin of marzipan in china from where the recipe moved on to the middle east and then to europe through alandalus\\nnortheast mediterranean line\\nalthough it is believed to have been introduced to eastern europe through the turks badem ezmesi in turkish and most notably produced in edirne there is some dispute between hungary and italy over its origin marzipan became a specialty of the hanseatic league port towns in particular the cities of lbeck and tallinn have a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture examples include lbecker marzipan pgi the citys manufacturers like niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain twothirds almonds by weight which results in a product of highest quality historically the city of knigsberg in east prussia was also renowned for its distinctive marzipan production knigsberg marzipan remains a special type of marzipan in germany that is golden brown on its surface and sometimes embedded with marmalade at its centre\\niberian peninsula line\\nanother possible geographic origin is the parts of spain that were known as alandalus in toledo 850900 though more probably 1150 during the reign of alfonso vii this specialty was known as postre regio instead of mazapn there are also mentions in the book of one thousand and one nights of an almond paste eaten during ramadan and as an aphrodisiac\\nmazapn is toledos most famous dessert often created for christmas and has pgi status for this almonds have to be at least 50 of the total weight following the directives of mazapn de toledo regulator council\\nanother idea to support this line is the important tradition of another spanish almondbased christmas confectionery the turrn\\nin the us marzipan is not officially defined but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste one brand for instance has 28 almonds in its marzipan and 45 almonds in its almond paste however in sweden and finland almond paste refers to a marzipan that contains 50 ground almonds a much higher quality than regular marzipan in germany lbecker marzipan is known for its quality it contains 66 almonds the original manually produced mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio marzipan\\nvariations\\npersipan is a similar yet less expensive product in which the almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials such as soy paste and almond essence to control and detect the authenticity of marzipan polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations less than 1 german marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste and french marzipan called massepain is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup some marzipan is flavoured with rosewater spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds in the us bitter almonds are not used in marzipan because the importation of bitter almonds into the us is prohibited by us law owing to them containing a substance related to cyanide sugar free marzipan can be made by replacing sugar with polyols such as maltitol\\netymology\\nthe german name has largely ousted the original english name marchpane with the same apparent derivation march bread the word marchpane occurs in shakespeares romeo and juliet act 1 scene 5 line 9 marzapane is documented earlier in italian than in any other language and the sense bread for pan is romance the origin could be from the latin term martius panis which means bread of march however the ultimate etymology is unclear for example the italian word derives from the latin words massa itself from greek  maza meaning pastry and pan meaning bread this can be particularly seen in the provenal massapan the portuguese maapo where  is an alternative form for the phoneme ss and old spanish mazapn  the change from ss to z in latin words was common in old spanish and the r appeared later it could also be derived from martis pan bread of march among the other possible etymologies set forth in the oxford english dictionary one theory proposes that the word marzipan may be a corruption of martaban a burmese city famous for its jars\\nthe real academia espaola suggests the idea of the spanish word mazapn to be derived from the hispanic arabic  pim which is derived from the greek \\nanother source could be from arabic  mawthbn king who sits still the arabic latinised as matapanus was used to describe a venetian coin depicting an enthroned christ the king these coins were stored in ornate boxes from about the fifteenth century when the coins were no longer in circulation the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats one such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the nowfamous almondflavoured marzipan named at least proximately after the box in which it was stored\\nhowever if marzipan has its origin in persia it is not unlikely that the name may come from marzban in persian  derived from the words marz  meaning border or boundary and the suffix bn  meaning guardian a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the sassanid empire of persia iran between the 3rd and 7th centuries\\nproduction\\nto produce marzipan raw almonds are cleaned by sieving air elutriation and other electronic or mechanical devices then immersed in water with a temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes in a process known as blanching this loosens the almonds skin which is removed by passing the almonds through rubbercovered rotating cylinders they are then cooled after which they are coarsely chopped and ground with up to 35 sugar into almond flour\\nthe almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled after which sucrose table sugar and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added it may then be moulded into any shape marzipan must be covered in an airtight container to prevent it from hardening and dehydrating it should be protected from direct light to prevent rancidity of almond oil a result of lipid oxidation\\nscience\\nmolecular composition\\nthe aroma and flavor of marzipan can be attributed to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide which both derive from the benzoin condensation reaction\\nphysical structure\\nmarzipan is a food emulsion that contains four phases a solid phase of suspended particles including almonds and sugars a suspended air pocket phase formed from incorporated air during mixing a water phase and a lipid phase from almond oil the phases can separate when left alone for long periods of time it is stabilized by the phospholipids and triglycerides found in the almond cells the fatty acids found in almonds include saturated fats such as stearic acid and unsaturated fats such as linoleic acid emulsifiers can be added during production to increase shelf life\\nmarzipans softness is a balance between the solid and liquid components it should have a moisture content of less than 10'}, {'title': 'Kom_Chuanchuen', 'label': 'Actor', 'text': 'akom

states that these groups are descended from a common segmented ancestor the articulata hypothesis is an alternative to the hypothesis that ecdysis the shedding of outer cuticle is a primitive characteristic  this would place panarthropoda in the group ecdysozoa\\norigins\\nthe articulata hypothesis originates from the phylogenetic analyses of georges cuvier in his 1817 published work le rgne animal distribu aprs son organization in this work cuvier theorized that all organisms exist as a functional whole meaning that all of the physiological structures of an organism are important for survival by studying these physiological structures cuvier was able to group the known animal kingdom according to structural similarities resulting from what he referred to as special groundplans which are analogous to blueprints each of these groundplans he further argued evolved separately from the others and structural similarities were due to common function and not to common ancestry from these groundplans cuvier separated the known animal kingdom into four branches or  vertebrata articulata mollusca and radiata from this phylogenetic grouping the articulata hypothesis was born\\nthe articulata hypothesis simply stated is the phylogenetic grouping of the phylum annelida which includes polychaetes oligochaetes and leeches together with the phylum arthropoda arachnids insects and crustaceans into the common taxon articulata cuvier grouped these diverse phyla together according to the common structural feature the segmented body plan this hypothesis further implies that all segmented organisms have a common ancestral origin\\ndevelopment\\nsince its original formulation in 1817 there have been significant challenges and modifications to the articulata hypothesis as new theories have been accepted darwins theory of evolution and new technologies have become available confocal microscopy dna sequencing genomics additionally the discovery of onychophora as its own phylum was incorporated into the theory by h bruce bordreaux \\ntheory of evolution\\ndarwins theory of evolution had a large yet often understated impact of the articulata hypothesis cuviers original articulata hypothesis was based on his assumption that current species no longer evolved because to evolve would cause loss of integral structures necessary for the survival of the species while the general acceptance of the theory of evolution weakened cuviers general theory of the unique groundplans as the origin of modern taxa it strengthened the articulata hypothesis by organizing annelids and arthropods into a clade descended from a common segmented ancestor\\nconfocal microscopy and modern molecular biology techniques\\nwhile each advance in modern molecular biology has shaken the phylogenetic tree of bilateria advances in molecular biology techniques led to further data supporting the articulata hypothesis but also led to the development of conflicting theories advances in confocal microscopy technology led to the discovery of embryonic cleavage patterns which differs between the annelids and arthropods annelids show spiral cleavage meaning that each embryonic cleavage occurs at progressive 90degree angles with respect to the animalvegetal axis arthropods on the other hand display a heterogeneous mix of embryonic cleavage patterns including spirallike cleavage and radial cleavage patterns this led researchers to two theories the first was that the arthropods lineage must have lost the ability to spiral cleave since differentiating from the last common ancestor between annelids and arthropods the second is that this showed similarities between annelids and mollusks who also spirally cleaves but lacks that the segmented body plan this was not the only interpretation of this data but other hypotheses were seen to have less data or merit other studies such as those looking a neural patterns within the articulata clade showed mixed patterns and thus mixed results\\ndna sequencing and genomics\\nthe advancements in dna sequencing techniques and the development of phylogenetic analysis algorithms led to the splitting of the articulata clade original phylogenetic studies on the sequences of 18s and 28s ribosomal dna sequence led to the suggestions that the annelids and arthropods had evolutionarily diverged much earlier than was previously thought but such limited genetic studies led to limited and often mixed results as more genes were added to the studies it became apparent that arthropods were genetically closer to nematodes and other molting organisms whereas the annelids were closer evolutionary to mollusks this ecdysozoa hypothesis is generally accepted today as the best supported evolutionary hypothesis for annelids and arthropods'}, {'title': 'Paracatenula', 'label': 'Animal', 'text': 'paracatenula is a genus of millimeter sized freeliving marine gutless catenulid flatworms\\nparacatenula is found

the frontal part of the worms  the rostrum  is transparent and bacteriafree and houses the brain while the trophosome region appears white due to light refracting inclusions in the bacterial symbionts some species of paracatenula such as p galateia possess a statocyst with a single statolith\\nlife cycle and reproduction\\nalthough paracatenula produce sperm and eggs that can be very informative to differentiate between species sexual reproduction has not been observed instead the worms reproduce by asexual fission or fragmentation a process called paratomy paracatenula worms have high regenerative capabilities and can regenerate a lost head including the brain within 1014 days the bacteriocytes of dividing worms are split during the fission process and the population of symbiotic bacteria is distributed to the two daughter individuals\\nhostsymbiont relationship\\nparacatenula host their symbionts within bacteriocytes in the trophosome these bacteria named ca riegeria belong to the lineage alphaproteobacteria forming a monophyletic group within the order rhodospirillales and the family rhodospirillaceae the cospeciation between host and bacteria suggests a strict vertical transmission of the bacteria in which the endosymbionts are directly transferred from parents to their offspring the symbiosis is shown to be beneficial for both partners the lack of both a gut lumen and a mouth indicate that the host derives most of its nutrition from its symbionts which have the potential for carbon dioxide fixation and sulfur oxidation in return the host provides its symbionts with a stable supply of electron donors such as sulfide and oxygen in a dynamic and heterogeneous environment furthermore symbionts living intracellularly in the worms are protected from predation as well as competition for nutrients by other bacteria\\nsymbiont physiology\\ndespite having a reduced genome with roughly 1400 genes ca riegeria symbionts have maintained a broad physiological repertoire which stands in contrast to all other reduced symbionts vertically transmitted for hundreds of millions of years ca r santandreae symbionts fix carbon dioxide store carbon in multiple storage compounds and produce all necessary building blocks for cellular life including sugars nucleotides amino acids vitamins and cofactors\\nhost provisioning\\nparacatenula lack mouth and gut and are nutritionally dependent on their symbionts in all other chemosynthetic symbioses the host acquires their nutrition by digestion of symbionts in contrast to this in paracatenula the symbionts cater their host by secreting outermembrane vesicles omvs and symbiont digestion is rare with their massive storage capabilities and the elegant way of providing the nutrition via omvs the symbionts have

solanum tuberosum have been reported to allow the nematode reproduction siam weed chromolaena odorata roselle hibiscus sabdariffa yam bean sphenostylis stenocarpa and pigeon pea cajanus cajan are also considered moderate hosts\\nmanagement\\nthere are basically three methods that can be applied for management of s bradys \\ncultural practices\\nusing non or poor crop host in rotation intercropping or as cover crop with yam will help reduce the nematode population in the soil in a recent study the use of porcupine jointvetch aeschynomene histrix mexican marigold tagetes erecta stylo stylosanthes guianensis velvet bean mucuna pruriens and kudzu pueraria phaseoloide intercropped with yam have shown to potential to reduce s bradys population similarly the exclusion of weed hosts such as eupatorium synedrella and chromolaena will help to reduce nematode damage\\nthe use of nematodefree propagative material is the most appropriate method to prevent nematode damage seed tubers should be examined before planting and the ones showing symptoms of dry rot should not be used it is important to note that in tubes not showing obvious external symptoms of damage it is necessary to scrape away the surface layers to determine the presence of dry rot\\nhot water treatment\\nstudies have shown that treating tubers with hot water 5055\\xa0c for up to 40 min gives the best control of s

one arm still remains of this smallish specimen at the united states national museum\\nit was moved to the new genus evasterias by addison emery verrill in 1914 with as the type species verrill published five new varieties alveolata densa parvispina rudis and subnodosa besides the nominate variety and also published e acanthostoma in 1914\\nalexander michailovitsch djakonov synonymised all of verrills varieties but retained alveolata as a forma and also made verrills e acanthostoma a form of e troschelii leaving the species with three forms including the nominate\\ndescription\\nthe mottled star is a large starfish with a radius of up to  it has a small disc and five long narrow arms often turned up at the tip the widest point of the arms is a little distance away from the edge of the disc the aboral upper or dorsal surface of the disc is covered with a network of calcareous plates with spines about long surrounded by smaller spines and crossed and straight pedicellariae minute pincerlike structures with two jaws there is an irregular line of whitetipped spines running down the centre of the arms and the whole upper surface is rough to the touch on the oral lower or ventral surface a long ambulacral groove stretches from the central mouth to the tip of each arm with four rows of tube feet and clumps of pedicellariae and spines on either side the colour is very variable and includes plain or mottled shades of orange brown greenishgrey bluishgrey and pale purple the outer edges of the arms often have a contrasting coloured rim and the underside is pale brown\\ndistribution and habitat\\nevasterias troschelii is found on the west coast of north america its range extends from pribilof islands alaska southwards to monterey bay california but it is rarely seen south of puget sound it also occurs in kamchatka bechevinskaya bay it is usually found on rocks and pebbles and occasionally on sand at depths down to about or  in bays and other sheltered locations it largely replaces the other common species of the area the purple sea star pisaster ochraceus\\necology\\nbreeding\\nin the north of its range breeding takes place from april to june large numbers of small eggs are produced and fertilisation is external the bipinnaria larvae that develop from these form part of the zooplankton and disperse with the currents\\nprey\\nthe mottled star is a predator and feeds largely on bivalve molluscs with its tube feet it can exert a powerful traction on the two valves of a mollusc shell pulling them sufficiently far apart to insert part of its stomach through the gap it then uses digestive enzymes to break down the molluscs tissues before sucking them out and removing its stomach from the shell it also consumes barnacles chitons gastropod molluscs tunicates and brachiopods some species of limpet exhibit behavioural responses to the presence of the mottled star and are able to evade it\\npetroleum hydrocarbons such as those released as a result of the exxon valdez spillage have a greater effect on the feeding and growth of the mottled star than on one of its main prey species the mussel mytilus edulis researchers surmised that pollution of the marine environment with oil might result in the domination of the mussel in the low intertidal zone of the region\\nother species interactions\\nthe scale worm arctonoe fragilis is often found living on the surface or in an ambulacral groove of the mottled star as a commensal the parasitic ciliate orchitophrya stellarum has several hosts one of which is the mottled star it lives among the spines on the body and arms until the starfish is ready to breed when it moves inside its host probably entering through a gonopore it makes its way to the gonads of the male starfish and feeds on the sperm effectively castrating its host\\njuvenile alaskan king crabs paralithodes camtschaticus have been observed living as commensals on the surface of the mottled star sheltering between its arms adult king crabs have been reported as attacking and eating the starfish it is also preyed on by gulls in the intertidal zone and by the morning sunstar solaster dawsoni and the

eleven arms but sometimes they may have either ten or twelve as fullgrown adults they are 8 to 10\\xa0cm in diameter\\nreproduction\\nthe starfish engages in external fertilization in which the female releases the eggs and the male releases the sperm fertilization occurs in the water column its breeding season is the summer during this time male and female starfish can be found extremely close or even on top of one another consequently spawning occurring several times from october through january\\nlife cycle\\nstichaster australis like the majority of other starfish exhibits two life stages planktonic and benthic once the eggs of the invertebrate are fertilized bilaterally symmetrical planktonic larvae are formed at this stage these larvae are known as bipinnaria the planktotrophic larval stage for s australis will last about 6 months with larvae typically settling any time from may through july it is during this time that the larvae now brachiolaria enters the benthic phase of life the brachiolaria will settle exclusively on the red algae mesophyllum insigne their only source of food until they mature m insigne can be found growing on both boulders and reefs located in the lower intertidal zone and subtidal zone both m insigne and the juvenile starfish are limited to the lower levels of the ecosystems as they have low tolerances for desiccation\\ngrowth and maturation\\nthe starfish can begin the metamorphosis into an adult once its characteristic radial symmetry is developed right after metamorphosis the critter has a diameter of about 085\\xa0mm initial growth of the starfish is slow until the addition of the 6th arm but once that happens the addition of new arms occurs more rapidly arm 7 will grow in between arms 6 and 1 arm 8 will grow in between arms 7 and 1 and arm 9 will grow in between arms 8 and 1 and so on the growth of arms occurs in a clockwise pattern when viewing the animal aborally the side containing the buttocks of the

old feed purely on m insigne the starfish will remain at the m insigne nursery for about a year this coralline alga is rich in calcium which is beneficial for the young starfish and its skeletal growth after this stage the diet of s australis shifts to include but is not limited to p canaliculus the starfish as it increases in size to about 2 to 25\\xa0cm in diameter and begins to mature will then solely feed on the mussels the diet of this starfish during the adult stage consists mainly of perna canaliculus the new zealand green mussel this carnivorous shift in diet is consistent with a relocation from the nursery algal spaces to close reefs containing dense populations of p canaliculus the mussel beds ultimately become the permanent home for this invertebrate in order to feed on the mussel stichaster australis utilizes its tubular feet to tug on the sides of the mussels shell once the shell is broken the starfish inserts its stomach to digest the innards of the prey once the sea star is finished digesting its prey it will swallow its own stomach back into its own body after feeding the starfish will leave white marks on the mussel a remnant of the predatory relationship\\nresearch\\nthis predatory relationship between starfish and mussels in this intertidal zone was studied by robert t paine in a paper published in 1971 the scientist removed s australis from the ecosystem for 9 months in this time p canaliculus with the removal of its primary predator was able to proliferate and increase its presence and hold in the ecosystem when expanding their area within the intertidal the mussels overgrew and outcompeted the other species decreasing the species richness in the area from 20 species to 14 species the mussels expanded its vertical distribution and 40 of the available space in the ecosystem was inhabited by these organisms paine proposed that s australis is a keystone species of the rocky intertidal of new zealand since it is

around the united kingdom juveniles were found to be plentiful growing on the bryozoan flustra foliacea large colonies sometimes form but these are seldom on rocks larvae may settle on the tubes of other worms and their subsequent development can form reefs these reefs are very fragile and often break up this is sometimes due to the activity of certain boring sponges such as cliona celata red boring sponge\\nbiology\\nthe tube of s vermicularis is made from calcite and aragonite calcium for its manufacture is stored in two white sacs on the ventral side of the peristomium the tube is fabricated by the glandular ventral shields on the other thoracic segments where calcium is mixed with an organic secretion to make a paste this is formed into shape by a collar found just behind the first segment the prostomium\\nserpula vermicularis is a filter feeder and extends its radioles to catch phytoplankton and detritus the radioles also act as gills blood is pumped in and out of these with the flow direction alternating in a single set of vessels the blood is then pumped through a ventral blood vessel to the tip of the abdomen before returning through a sinus adjoining the gut\\nthe blood of s vermicularis contains the oxygenbinding pigment chlorocruorin as well as transporting oxygen to the tissues this binds carbon monoxide much more efficiently than does human haemoglobin this may be the reason why the worm may settle and grow on brown seaweeds such as fucus but avoids giant kelp nereocystis the latter uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumocysts and

nematodes to be taxonomically described by jg steinbuch in 1799 while on a botanical walk steinbuch collected samples from a grass that resembled agrostis silvatica he examined the samples and discovered that the grass was not a silvatica but was rather a degenerate form of agrostis capillaris he further discovered that a silvatica is not a true species or variety but that the misclassification of the grass was due to the formation of galls by a agrostis parasitism galls caused by a agrostis have glumes that are 45 times longer than normal and can cause yield losses of up to 4070 in addition to crop loss a agrostis associates with pathogenic bacteria rathayibacter rathayi formerly corynebacterium rathayi to cause annual ryegrass toxicity in australia\\nhosts and

the j2 invades the ovule becomes sedentary and a gall begins to form within the gall nematodes progress through three molts to reach adulthood j3 j4 male and female adults reproduction is amphimictic and females can lay up to 1000 eggs the first molt occurs in the egg and the nematode hatches as a j2 these juveniles undergo anhydrobiosis and become the dormant dauer larvae to withstand the hot

the flower ovule and begin to feed endoparasitically nematode feeding on floret primordia induces rapid cell division cell enlargement and subsequent cell degeneration and collapse the continuation of this process results in the formation of a large central cavity in which the nowsedentary nematodes reside enveloped by a gall wall gall size increases rapidly as nematodes grow and reproduce the gall wall is several cell layers thick inner cells of the gall wall near the cavity have dense cytoplasm with several mitochondria indicating high levels of metabolic activity these cells most likely provide nutrients to the nematodes the outer layers of the gall wall are unmodified thereby forming and maintaining the gall structure as the plant senesces the galls desiccate and the nematodes undergo anhydrobiosis\\nmanagement\\nto mitigate the effects of annual ryegrass toxicity farmers can move their livestock another uninfected pasture at first sign of toxicity hot water treatments or chemical seed treatments have been used to produce clean seed infected pastures can be managed by mowing herbicide treatments or burning these techniques eliminate the development of inflorescences

microsoft xenix sun microsystems sunossolaris hphpe hpux and ibm aix in the early 1990s atampt sold its rights in unix to novell which then sold its unix business to the santa cruz operation sco in 1995 the unix trademark passed to the open group an industry consortium founded in 1996 which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the single unix specification sus however novell continues to own the unix copyrights which the sco group inc v novell inc court case 2010 confirmed\\nunix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the unix philosophy according to this philosophy the operating system should provide a set of simple tools each of which performs a limited welldefined function a unified and inodebased filesystem the unix filesystem and an interprocess communication mechanism known as pipes serve as the main means of communication and a shell scripting and command language the unix shell is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows\\nunix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system almost the entire operating system is written in the c programming language which allows unix to operate on numerous platforms\\noverview\\nunix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems rather than for nonprogrammers the system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in academic circles and as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues\\nat first unix was not designed to be portable or for multitasking later unix gradually gained portability multitasking and multiuser capabilities in a timesharing configuration unix systems are characterized by various concepts the use of plain text for storing data a hierarchical file system treating devices and certain types of interprocess communication ipc as files and the use of a large number of software tools small programs that can be strung together through a commandline interpreter using pipes as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality these concepts are collectively known as the unix philosophy brian kernighan and rob pike summarize this in the unix programming environment as the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\\nby the early 1980s users began seeing unix as a potential universal operating system suitable for computers of all sizes the unix environment and the clientserver program model were essential elements in the development of the internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers\\nboth unix and the c programming language were developed by atampt and distributed to government and academic institutions which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system\\nthe unix operating system consists of many libraries and utilities along with the master control program the kernel the kernel provides services to start and stop programs handles the file system and other common lowlevel tasks that most programs share and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously to mediate such access the kernel has special rights reflected in the distinction of kernel space from user space the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate\\nhistory\\nthe origins of unix date back to the mid1960s when the massachusetts institute of technology bell labs and general electric were developing multics a timesharing operating system for the ge645 mainframe computer\\nmultics featured several innovations but also presented severe problems frustrated by the size and complexity of multics but not by its goals individual researchers at bell labs started withdrawing from the project the last to leave were ken thompson dennis ritchie douglas mcilroy and joe ossanna who decided to reimplement their experiences in a new project of smaller scale this new operating system was initially without organizational backing and also without a name\\nthe new operating system was a singletasking system in 1970 the group coined the name unics for uniplexed information and computing service as a pun on multics which stood for multiplexed information and computer services brian kernighan takes credit for the idea but adds that no one can remember the origin of the final spelling unix dennis ritchie doug mcilroy and peter g neumann also credit kernighan\\nthe operating system was originally written in assembly language \\nbut in 1973 version 4 unix was rewritten in c version 4 unix however still had many pdp11 dependent codes and was not suitable for porting the first port to another platform was made five years later 1978 for the interdata 832\\nin 1974 ken robinson of the department of computer science at university of new south wales unsw in australia requested a copy of unix for their pdp1140 minicomputer from dennis ritchie at bell labs this 1975 installation made unsw the first university outside the united states to run unix\\nbell labs produced several versions of unix that are collectively referred to as research unix in 1975 the first source license for unix was sold to donald b gillies at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign department of computer science uiuc uiuc graduate student greg chesson who had worked on the unix kernel at bell labs was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license\\nduring the late 1970s and early 1980s the influence of unix in academic circles led to largescale adoption of unix bsd and system\\xa0v by commercial startups which in turn led to unix fragmenting into multiple similar but often slightly mutuallyincompatible systems including dynix hpux sunossolaris aix and xenix in the late 1980s atampt unix system laboratories and sun microsystems developed system\\xa0v release\\xa04 svr4 which was subsequently adopted by many commercial unix vendors\\nin the 1990s unix and unixlike systems grew in popularity and became the operating system of choice for over 90 of the worlds top 500 fastest supercomputers as bsd and linux distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers in 2000 apple released darwin also a unix system which became the core of the mac os x operating system later renamed macos\\nunix operating systems are widely used in modern servers workstations and mobile devices\\nstandards\\nin the late 1980s an open operating system standardization effort now known as posix provided a common baseline for all operating systems ieee based posix around the common structure of the major competing variants of the unix system publishing the first posix standard in 1988 in the early 1990s a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium the common open software environment cose initiative which eventually became the single unix specification sus administered by the open group starting in 1998 the open group and ieee started the austin group to provide a common definition of posix and the single unix specification which by 2008 had become the open group base specification\\nin 1999 in an effort towards compatibility several unix system vendors agreed on svr4s executable and linkable format elf as the standard for binary and object code files the common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different unix systems operating on the same cpu architecture\\nthe filesystem hierarchy standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for unixlike operating systems it has mainly been used in linux\\ncomponents\\nthe unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together by including the development environment libraries documents and the portable modifiable source code for all of these components in addition to the kernel of an operating system unix was a selfcontained software system this was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence\\nthe inclusion of these components did not make the system large the original v7 unix distribution consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10\\xa0mb and arrived on a single ninetrack magnetic tape the printed documentation typeset from the online sources was contained in two volumes\\nthe names and filesystem locations of the unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system nonetheless the v7 implementation is considered by many to have the canonical early structure\\nimpact\\nthe unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems it achieved its reputation by its interactivity by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use by running on inexpensive hardware and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines unix was originally written in assembly language but was soon rewritten in c a highlevel programming language although this followed the lead of multics and burroughs mcp it was unix that popularized the idea\\nunix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays the file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices such as printers terminals or disk drives providing a uniform interface but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple stream of bytes model the plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms\\nunix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories originally introduced by multics other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections but they had a fixed number of levels often only one level several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after multics decs rsx11ms group user hierarchy evolved into openvms directories cpms volumes evolved into msdos 20 subdirectories and hps mpe groupaccount hierarchy and ibms ssp and os400 library systems were folded into broader posix file systems\\nmaking the command interpreter an ordinary userlevel program with additional commands provided as separate programs was another multics innovation popularized by unix the unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting shell scripts\\xa0 there was no separate job control language like ibms jcl since the shell and os commands were just another program the user could choose or even write their own shell new commands could be added without changing the shell itself unixs innovative commandline syntax for creating modular chains of producerconsumer processes pipelines made a powerful programming paradigm coroutines widely available many later commandline interpreters have been inspired by the unix shell\\na fundamental simplifying assumption of unix was its focus on newlinedelimited text for nearly all file formats there were no binary editors in the original version of unix\\xa0 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts the common denominator in the io system was the byte\\xa0 unlike recordbased file systems the focus on text for representing nearly everything made unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ad hoc tasks the focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems over time textbased applications have also proven popular in application areas such as printing languages postscript odf and at the application layer of the internet protocols eg ftp smtp http soap and sip\\nunix popularized a syntax for regular expressions that found widespread use the unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard posix see above the c programming language soon spread beyond unix and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming\\nearly unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice spawning a software tools movement over time the leading developers of unix and programs that ran on it established a set of cultural norms for developing software norms which became as important and influential as the technology of unix itself this has been termed the unix philosophy\\nthe tcpip networking protocols were quickly implemented on the unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers which contributed to the internet explosion of worldwide realtime connectivity and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms\\nthe unix policy of extensive online documentation and for many years ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations and contributed to the launch of the free software movement in 1983\\nfree unix and unixlike variants\\nin 1983 richard stallman announced the gnu short for gnus not unix project an ambitious effort to create a free software unixlike system free in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use study modify and redistribute it the gnu projects own kernel development project gnu hurd had not yet produced a working kernel but in 1991 linus torvalds released the linux kernel as free software under the gnu general public license in addition to their use in the gnu operating system many gnu packages\\xa0 such as the gnu compiler collection and the rest of the gnu toolchain the gnu c library and the gnu core utilities\\xa0 have gone on to play central roles in other free unix systems as well\\nlinux distributions consisting of the linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business popular distributions include red hat enterprise linux fedora suse linux enterprise opensuse debian ubuntu linux mint mandriva linux slackware linux arch linux and gentoo\\na free derivative of bsd unix 386bsd was released in 1992 and led to the netbsd and freebsd projects with the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the university of california and berkeley software design inc usl v bsdi by unix system laboratories it was clarified that berkeley had the right to distribute bsd unix for free if it so desired since then bsd unix has been developed in several different product branches including openbsd and dragonfly bsd\\nlinux and bsd are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary unix operating systems as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices because of the modular design of the unix model sharing components is relatively common consequently most or all unix and unixlike systems include at least some bsd code and some systems also include gnu utilities in their distributions\\nin a 1999 interview dennis ritchie voiced his opinion that linux and bsd operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the unix design and are derivatives of unix\\nin the same interview he states that he views both unix and linux as the continuation of ideas that were started by ken and me and many others many years ago\\nopensolaris was the free software counterpart to solaris developed by sun microsystems which included a cddllicensed kernel and a primarily gnu userland however oracle discontinued the project upon their acquisition of sun which prompted a group of former sun employees and members of the opensolaris community to fork opensolaris into the illumos kernel as of 2014 illumos remains the only active opensource system v derivative\\narpanet\\nin may 1975 rfc 681 described the development of network unix by the center for advanced computation at the university of illinois urbanachampaign the unix system was said to present several interesting capabilities as an arpanet minihost at the time unix required a license from bell telephone laboratories that cost us20000 for nonuniversity institutions while universities could obtain a license for a nominal fee of 150 it was noted that bell was open to suggestions for an arpanetwide license\\nthe rfc specifically mentions that unix offers powerful local processing facilities in terms of user programs several compilers an editor based on qed a versatile document preparation system and an efficient file system featuring sophisticated access control mountable and demountable volumes and a unified treatment of peripherals as special files the latter permitted the network control program ncp to be integrated within the unix file system treating network connections as special files that could be accessed through standard unix io calls which included the added benefit of closing all connections on program exit should the user neglect to do so the modular design of unix allowed them to minimize the amount of code added to the basic unix kernel with much of the ncp code in a swappable user process running only when needed\\nbranding\\nin october 1993 novell the company that owned the rights to the unix system v source at the time transferred the trademarks of unix to the xopen company now the open group and in 1995 sold the related business operations to santa cruz operation sco whether novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006 sco v novell which novell won the case was appealed but on august 30 2011 the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit affirmed the trial decisions closing the case unix vendor sco group inc accused novell of slander of title\\nthe present owner of the trademark unix is the open group an industry standards consortium only systems fully compliant with and certified to the single unix specification qualify as unix others are called unixlike\\nby decree of the open group the term unix refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system those operating systems which meet the open groups single unix specification should be able to bear the unix 98 or unix 03 trademarks today after the operating systems vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to the open group systems that have been licensed to use the unix trademark include aix euleros hpux inspur kux irix macos solaris tru64 unix formerly digital unix or osf1 and zos notably euleros and inspur kux are linux distributions certified as unix\\xa003 compliant\\nsometimes a representation like unx nix or nx is used to indicate all operating systems similar to unix this comes from the use of the asterisk  and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities this notation is also used to describe other unixlike systems that have not met the requirements for unix branding from the open group\\nthe open group requests that unix is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as system to help avoid the creation of a genericized trademark\\nunix was the original formatting but the usage of unix remains widespread because it was once typeset in small caps unix according to dennis ritchie when presenting the original unix paper to the third operating systems symposium of the american association for computing machinery acm we had a new typesetter and troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps many of the operating systems predecessors and contemporaries used alluppercase lettering so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit it is not an acronym\\ntrademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories the result is that unix has been used as a brand name for various products including bookshelves ink pens bottled glue diapers hair driers and food containers\\nseveral plural forms of unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of unix and unixlike systems most common is the conventional unixes but unices treating unix as a latin noun of the third declension is also popular the pseudoanglosaxon plural form unixen is not common although occasionally seen sun microsystems developer of the solaris variant has asserted that the term unix is itself plural referencing its many implementations'}, {'title': 'Commodore_DOS', 'label': 'Software', 'text': 'commodore dos also known as cbm dos is the disk operating system used with commodores 8bit computers unlike most other doses which are loaded from disk into the computers own ram and executed there cbm dos is executed internally in the drive the dos resides in rom chips inside the drive and is run there by one or more dedicated mos 6502 family cpus thus data transfer between commodore 8bit computers and their disk drives more closely resembles a local area network connection than typical diskhost transfers\\ncbm dos versions\\nat least seven distinctly numbered versions of commodore dos are known to exist the following list gives the version numbers and related disk drives unless otherwise noted drives are 5inch format the lp code designates lowprofile drives drives whose model number starts with 15 connect via commodores unique serial ieee488 bus iec bus serial talklisten protocols all others use the parallel ieee488\\nversion 26 was by far the most commonly used and widely known dos version due to its use in the 1541 as part of c64 systems\\nnote the revised firmware for the 1571 which fixed the relative file bug was also identified as v30 thus it is not possible to differentiate the two versions using the version number alone\\ntechnical overview\\n1541 directory and file types\\nthe 1541 commodore floppy disk can contain up to 144 files in a flat namespace no subdirectories the directory is stored on reserved track 18 which is located halfway from the hub to the edge of a 35track singlesided disk a file name may be up to 16 bytes in length and is theoretically unique by using direct access methods on the directory structure it is possible to rename a file to that of anotheralthough accessing such files may be difficult or impossible files with identical names usually serve no purpose except to inform or visually manage files one popular trick used for example by the final cartridge iii was to add files named codice1 of type codice2 to the directory and files could then be rearranged around those lines to form groups many game developers warez group members and demoscene hackers used some more clever custom directory entries as well\\nfile names may contain a shifted space character codice3 and if the directory listing is being viewed from basic the portion of the file name beyond the codice3 character will appear to have been separated from the first part of the file name by a quotation mark causing basic to not consider it to be part of the full file name this feature can be used to create directory entries such as  which will then appear in the directory listing as for example  when the user moves the cursor to the beginning of the line types the word codice5 over the file size and presses  basic interprets that as  causing the program to be loaded into memory anything after the colon or the secondary address will not be executed since the computer ignores any command after a load alternatively the user could press to and the program automatically\\na null byte embedded in a file name will interrupt the listing after loading by basic if there are three null bytes that makes it difficult to list through basic many machine language programmers would experiment with null bytes in an attempt to make it harder for basic programmers to access their code and tamper with it\\nin basic the directory can be accessed as a nonexecutable pseudobasic program with or in the case of a dual drive followed by codice6 the first line has a line number of 0 or 1 indicating the drive number showing in reverse video the name and id of the disk and a shorthand code for the dos version with which it was created codes vary only as far as the dos versions use incompatible disk formats 2a is used by most 525inch dos versions 3d by the35 inch 1581 lines after this have the size of a file in disk blocks as their pseudo line number followed by the file name in quotes and the threeletter type code the last line shows the number of unallocated blocks on the disk again as a pseudo line number followed by the words blocks free\\non the commodore 64 entering will flood the screen with garbage instead of loading the directory into basic ram this is because the drive assigns the directory a load address of 0401 1025 which is equivalent to the start of basic for the commodore pet but corresponds to the default screen memory in the c64 starting with the second character on the first line of the screen\\nviewing the directory with a command overwrites the basic program in memory the dos wedge and various thirdparty cartridges and extenders such as epyx fast load action replay and the final cartridge iii allow viewing of the disk directory using special commands that load the directory into screen memory without destroying the current basic program some versions of commodore basic include a codice7 or codice8 command that performs the same function\\nthe following file types are supported\\n a sequential file is a data file that can be linearly read from start to finish codice9 files are commonly used to store documents or text files created by a word processor or other such editor a sequential file is analogous to a flat file in linux or unix in that it has no specialized internal structure it is not possible to position to any arbitrary location in a sequential file as there is no analog of the codice11 kernel call found in unixlike operating systems\\n codice12 files normally contain executable program code although they can also be used for data files the first two bytes of the codice12 are read by the kernal load file routine and used to determine the load address they are stored in a little endian format\\n a relative file is a variation of the sequential file type in which an indexing mechanism referred to as sidesectors is present to permit recordoriented access records may be a maximum of 254 bytes in size and are addressed by a onebased cardinal number permitting true random access to any part of the file\\n a userspecified file has an internal structure that is identical to that of a sequential file commodores original purpose for this file type was the facilitation of dos development as the file content could be copied into a drive buffer for execution by the drives microprocessor very few programs ever made use of this file type some applications that use nonstandard lowlevel disk structures save data in usr format which came to be considered a sort of leave me alone dont try to copy or delete indication to the user most notably geos vlir files show up as codice16 files\\n an undocumented internally used file type similar in structure to a sequential file creation of this file type must be accomplished by direct manipulation of the disk directory\\nthe presence of an asterisk codice19 prepended to the file type in a directory listing for example codice20 indicates that the file was not properly closed after writing when the drive is commanded to close a file that has been opened for writing the associated buffer is flushed to the disk and the block availability map bam is updated to accurately reflect which blocks have been used if a program crash or other problem such as the user removing the disk while a file is open results in an orphan file also referred to as a poison or splat file buffers are not flushed and the bam will not accurately reflect disk usage putting the disk at risk of corruption a poison file generally cannot be accessed but can be opened in modify mode and an attempt to use the dos codice21 command to delete the file may cause filesystem corruption such as crosslinking the only practical method of removing one of these files is by opening the file in modify mode and fixing it or by validating the disk see the dos codice22 command below the latter which rebuilds the bam and removes poison file references from the directory the infamous savewithreplace bug could result in creation of splat files\\ncodice23 is a special type written into the ondisk directory entry of files that have been deleted such files are not shown in a normal directory listing and their data blocks and directory entries will be reused by files that are subsequently created some utility programs allow the undeletion of such files if their data blocks and directory entries haven not yet been overwritten by other files codice24 are commonly used to insert banners or comment sections into a directory listing\\nfile types with codice25 after them for example codice26 are locked and cannot be deletedthey can be opened for reading however there is no commodore dos command that can explicitly set or clear this status but many thirdparty utilities were written to allow this to be done these utilities generally read the directory using directaccess commands perform the necessary modifications to the raw data and then write the changes back to the disk\\nfile access\\naccessing files is primarily an issue for the host computer the kernal rom in the computer contains the necessary primitive routines needed to access files and the basic rom contains a higher level abstraction for file access using basic syntax the components that concern the dos itself are file name parsing and the secondary address this section will give an overview of the necessary basic commands for the sake of completeness\\nopening a file on a commodore disk unit entails the processing of a number of parameters that are vaguely analogous to file opening procedures in other environments since the dos is actually running in the drives controller the file opening sequence must pass enough information to the drive to assure unambiguous interpretation a typical statement in basic to write to a sequential file would be as follows\\nthe parameters following the codice27 verb are as follows\\nthis parameter the file number logically identifies the opened file within the computers operating system and is analogous to a file descriptor in unixlike operating systems it is never sent to the drive and thus is neither known nor used by the drives own operating system the file number may be in the range of 1 to 254 inclusive is assigned by the programmer and must be unique if more than one file is simultaneously opened once the file has been opened all program input and output procedures use the file number in assembly language programs this value is often referred to as la logical address the abbreviation coming from the mnemonic that refers to the memory location where the file number is stored file numbers greater than 127 cause the system to write an extra line feed after each carriage return useful for double spacing a document as an example\\nthis parameter the device number identifies a specific peripheral attached to the computer devices 0 through 3 address the keyboard tape cassette rs232 interface and video display respectively all of which are directly controlled by the kernal rom device numbers 4 and higher address devices attached to the peripheral bus such as printers or disk drives in the case of a disk drive the device number refers to the units controller not the drive mechanisms within the unit by convention the first disk drive unit on a system has device number 8 the second drive if present 9 etc up to a maximum number of 15 when eight disk drives are attached the device number scheme was derived from the ieee488 or general purpose interface gpib bus that was used with the commodore petcbm models in assembly language programs this value is often referred to as fa or pa physical address again from the mnemonic for the memory location where the device number is stored\\nthis parameter the secondary address which may range from 0 to 15 inclusive refers to a specific communication channel established with the devices controller and is passed to the device when it is commanded to talk or listen on the peripheral bus as with the file number the secondary address is determined by the programmer and must be unique for the device in question the range 0 to 14 inclusive is used for passing data to or from the device whereas 15 referred to as the command channel is used to issue commands to the devices controller such as to rename a disk file if the device is able to support such an operation in disk drives secondary addresses 0 to 14 inclusive are mapped to buffers within the controller hence establishing communication with a specific file on a specific disk since as mentioned above the drive does not know about the file number it can only use the secondary address to make a difference between several files that are open at the same time on the other hand the host operating system is agnostic about the secondary address it is transmitted to the drive on every access to the file but not otherwise used by the host in assembly language programs this value is often referred to as sa secondary address\\nthe codice28 parameter is officially referred to in commodore documentation as the command string and is interpreted by the controller of the device being accessed in the case of a disk drive unit the formal command string structure consists of the drive mechanism number codice29 not to be confused with the device number filename codice30 file type codice31 sequential in this example and access mode codice32 opened for writing in this example in practice some of these parameters may be omitted minimally only the filename is required if the file is to be opened for reading\\nthe drive number identifies a drive mechanism attached to a disk units controller and is analogous to a logical unit number in a scsi controller that is capable of controlling multiple mechanisms eg the omti sasi controllers that were developed to work with st412st506 hard drives in the 1980s in floppy disk units the first mechanism is drive 0 and the second is 1 it is fairly common practice to omit the drive number when communicating with a single drive floppy unit as 0 is the default in such units but since omitting the number can trigger a few obscure bugs in the dos it is not a recommended practice a colon alone is equivalent to 0 and is enough to avoid those bugs an exception to this convention is with the lt kernal hard disk subsystem in which the drive number refers to logical units virtual drives created on a single physical drive which made syntax such as 4 or 10 necessary if a file to be opened was not on logical unit zero equivalent to drive mechanism zero in a dual floppy unit\\nfiles can also be loaded and saved to with codice5 and codice34 commands file name specifiers can also be used here for example saves the basic program to a codice12 program file and saves the basic program to a sequential file if the secondary address isnt specified or is specified as 0 eg  the file is savedloaded from the basic memory area which on the c64 starts by default at 0801 if the secondary address is specified as a nonzero value eg  the program is loaded starting from the address specified by the file itself the prg header which is the first two bytes of the filethis form of command is more common when loading machine code programs\\nload relocation was first introduced on the vic20 because this machine could start basic ram in several different locations depending on the memory expansion that was installed the older commodore pet series did not support relocation so and would have the same effect the file would be loaded into the same memory region from which it was saved load relocation happens in the host being an exception to what is said above about the secondary address being used only deviceinternally since the pet cannot relocate files basic programs written on later commodore machines must be modified by using a sector editor to change the header bytes it is also possible to use the pets builtin machine language monitor to change the link address for the basic program after loading it\\nthe command will load the first program on the disk starting from the filespecified memory location this is one of the most popular load commands of the platforms the method to start majority of commercial software for example of note is the fact that the wildcard expansion will only pick the first catalog name when no other file on that disk has been accessed before the name of the lastused file is kept in memory and subsequent commands will load that file rather than the first however or will always load the first file on the disk\\nthe directories of disks in twodrive units are accessed as and  codice36 and codice37 do not access the directory but actual files on one drive or the other that just happen to be named codice38 partial directories can be loaded by adding a colon and a template for example would load a partial directory that shows only the files whose name starts with the letter k and which are of type prg all such partial directories still contain the initial disk name line and the final blocks free line\\nthe savewithreplace bug\\ncommodore dos also offers a savewithreplace command which allows a file to be saved over an existing file without the need to first codice39 the existing file this was done by prepending an codice40 symbol to the file name during the codice27 or codice34 operation  for instance  for years rumors spread beginning with the 4040 drive of a bug in the commands implementation at first this was denied by some commentators prizes were offered to prove the existence of the bug by early 1985 compute magazine advised readers to avoid using the command that year various authors independently published articles proving that the savewithreplace bug was real and including methods by which it could be triggered\\naffected devices included the singledrive 1541 and dualdrive 4040 the 8050 and 8250 did not exhibit the issue some commentators suggested the bug could be avoided by always explicitly specifying the codice29 drive number when saving though it was later shown that any disk operations without a drive number were sufficient to lead to the bug the bug stemmed from the fact that the affected dos implementations were modified versions of the dos contained in earlier commodore pet dual drives such as the 8050 this created a phantom drive codice44 on singledrive systems resulting in the allocation of an unnecessary buffer under some conditions since the savewithreplace command used all five drive buffers and because the method by which the phantom buffer was allocated did not meet specifications this resulted in scrambled data being written to the disk under some conditions\\nin september 1986 philip a slaymaker published an article describing in great detail the cause of the bug and providing patches to the 1541 drive roms readers with an eprom burner could produce their own patched roms which could be swapped into the drive commodore was made aware of slaymakers findings and while they never issued an official update for the original 1541s roms they did fix the bug in revision 5 of the 1571 roms and also in the roms for the 1541c and 1541ii drives although not supported by commodore it is known that the 1541ii firmware but not that of the 1541c can also be used in an original 1541 drive by using eproms which will fix the bug for that drive as well\\ncommand channel\\nas previously noted the commodore dos itself is accessed via the command channel using syntax like that used to access files issuing commands to the dos and retrieving status and error messages generated in response to commands is accomplished by opening a file to the device using 15 as the secondary address for example\\nto retrieve and display the device status one could code\\nin the above example codice45 will hold the error number if any it will be zero if no error exists codice46 will be a terse text description of the error codice47 will represent the disk track where the error occurred and codice31 will be the sector on track codice47 to which the error refers if no error exists the equivalent of will be returned in the four variables note that codice50 is a run mode only verb also in programs that issue many disk commands it is customary to open a file to the devices command channel at the start of the program and not close it until the program has finished\\ncommodore basic versions 40 and later provide a pseudovariable referred to as codice51 that may be used to retrieve drive status in lieu of the above code this reserved variable is not available on earlier versions of basic so the command channel must be manually read as demonstrated above note that immediately after poweron or reset the dos revision will be returned for example a 1541 will return  error code 73 is common to all drive models and may be used to determine if the drive has been reset to its poweron state\\ndos commands\\nthere are also a command for seeking in relative type files codice52 several blocklevel directaccess commands codice53 codice54 codice55 block management codice56 codice57 drive memory manipulation and execution of program code on the drives processor codice58 codice59 codice60 codice61 and userdefinable functions codice62 and codice63 commands some of the theoretically userdefinable functions were rededicated for accessing new functionality in dos versions after 10'}, {'title': 'IOS_9', 'label': 'Software', 'text': 'ios 9 is the ninth major release of the ios mobile operating system developed by apple inc being the successor to ios 8 it was announced at the companys worldwide developers conference on june 8 2015 and was released on september 16 2015 it was succeeded by ios 10 on september 13 2016\\nios 9 incorporated many feature updates to builtin apps most notably notes received the ability to draw sketches with different tools image insertion prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations and advanced list formatting an allnew apple news app aggregates articles from different sources and apple maps received mass transit support although in a limited number of locations at launch major new system updates include proactivity where siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information such as time and location and can provide the user with information ahead of time for searching the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widgetlike format including weather sports news and more ios 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the ipad in ios 93 apple added a night shift mode that changes the color of the devices display to a warmer less blue light containing shade to reduce any negative eye health effects on users circadian rhythms additionally ios 9 brought new user experience functions including quick actions and peek and pop based on the touchsensitive display technology in the iphone 6s quick actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons users can preview peek at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter pop the previewed content into full view\\nreception of ios 9 was positive critics praised proactivity and siri for making the notification center a central location for all information and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality the new multitasking features for the ipad were complimented as were drawing and photo insertion in the notes app however apple news was criticized for a low number of decentlooking articles and apple maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support\\nfive days after release apple announced that ios 9 had been installed on more than 50 of active ios devices which apple described as the fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\\nhistory\\nintroduction and initial release\\nios 9 was introduced at the apple worldwide developers conference on june 8 2015 with the first beta made available to registered developers after the keynote and a public beta made available in july this marked the first time that the general public had been able to test new versions of ios before official release with eddy cue apples senior vice president of internet software and services telling fast company that the public beta program was started because of maps referring to the companys apple maps launch that had significant issues in its early days\\nios 9 was officially released on september 16 2015\\nsystem features\\n3d touch\\non the iphone 6s and iphone 6s plus a touchsensitive display feature called 3d touch is incorporated into ios 9 it is similar to force touch which can be found on the trackpad of some apple macbook computers quick actions and shortcuts are added to apps that support the 3d touch feature and are triggered by pressing slightly harder on the app icon it also introduces actions known as peek and pop which lets users firmly hold to preview peek any kind of content in a hovering window before they optionally apply more pressure to enter pop the content into full view\\nthe taptic engine in the iphone 6s provides haptic feedback each time users press the screen harder\\nbattery\\nios 9 comes with two important batterysaving updates when a phone has been placed facedown the screen will not light up upon receiving notifications apple has also added low power mode which modifies the amount of energy dedicated to background services and animations for example background app refresh and push email are paused during low power mode when a phone reaches 20 battery level users are automatically prompted to turn on low power mode which changes the color of the battery icon in the top row status bar on the screen to yellow when the battery goes higher than the 80 level low power mode automatically turns back off\\ndesign\\nsan francisco a new system font replaced helvetica neue as the system typeface of ios\\nios 9 added a new battery widget to the notification center that displayed the battery life and charging status of any connected bluetooth device\\nwhen the shift button is inactive lowercase letters are displayed on the keyboard instead of the allcaps representation on previous ios versions\\ninstallation\\nios 9 is a smaller update than ios 8 requiring 13\\xa0gb of space compared to 458\\xa0gb for ios 8 additionally ios 9 includes an option to temporarily delete apps to allow the update to install once the update has been installed the apps will be automatically restored ios 9 also features app thinning functionality whereby only the necessary assets needed to run apps on each individual device is downloaded rather than the entire app potentially saving space\\nmultitasking\\nios 9 adds a number of features to the ipad to improve productivity these include slide over split screen and picture in picture for enhanced multitasking similar to the experience found on os x el capitan slide over allows the user to pull in a second app with a swipe from the right edge of the display this app takes up 13 of the screen and sticks to the right side of the screen while interactivity within the fullscreen app is disabled while left inactive in the background the feature allows users to perform quick tasks and then dismiss the app again\\nif the user taps on the handle next to the slide over window or extends the window further towards the left of the screen the user enters split screen which allows them to interact with two apps simultaneously sidebyside in a 5050 split users can also switch to another app in either slide over mode or split screen view by pulling down on the handle on top of either app and selecting another app from the list to replace the existing one\\npicture in picture mode allows users to minimize facetime calls or supported videos to a smaller window and continue watching them while doing other tasks on the ipad\\nthe split screen multitasking feature is only available for ipad air 2 ipad mini 4 and ipad pro while the slide over and picture in picture features are available on the ipad air ipad air 2 ipad mini 2 and newer and the ipad pro\\nwhen banner notifications are tapped causing another app to open a back button at the topleft corner of the screen has been added bringing the user back to the previous app\\nnight shift\\nnight shift is a display mode introduced in ios 93 the mode shifts the colors of the devices display to be warmer similar to flux a popular program for microsoft windows and apple macos computers when enabled it uses the devices clock and geographic location to determine when to turn the feature on or off optionally the user can set a manual schedule or not have a schedule at all for ease of access there is a new night shift toggle in the control center the settings for night shift are located under display and brightness in the settings app and on top of enabling the feature and setting a schedule the user can also set the warmth of the display\\ndespite being introduced in ios 93 in march 2016 it wasnt possible to use night shift and low power mode simultaneously until the release of ios 932 two months later night shift requires a 64bit processor only found in the apple a7 or newer chips which means older ios devices including the iphone 4s iphone 5 iphone 5c ipad 2 ipad 3 ipad 4 firstgeneration ipad mini and 5th generation ipod touch do not receive night shift mode\\nperformance\\nios 9 includes performance and speed improvements thanks to the expanded use of the metal api metal was introduced in ios 8 and was previously limited to game developers in ios 9 the use of metal is expanded to let it handle many of the core user interface elements and graphics\\nproactivity\\nintelligence is one of the main features in ios 9 consisting of the newly integrated siri and search previously known as spotlight as well as proactivity throughout the operating system ios is now more aware of contextual information such as time and location and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort when typing search has also been improved to display instant answers in an ataglance widgetlike format similar to that provided in the siri interface search can display current weather

digital distribution and digital rights management platform developed by blizzard entertainment the service was launched on december 31 1996 followed a few days later with the release of blizzards actionroleplaying video game diablo on january 3 1997 battlenet was officially renamed to blizzard battlenet in august 2017\\nbattlenet was the first online gaming service incorporated directly into the games that make use of it in contrast to the external interfaces used by the other online services at the time this feature along with ease of account creations and the absence of member fees caused battlenet to become popular among gamers and became a major selling point for diablo and subsequent blizzard games since the successful launch of battlenet many companies have created online game services mimicking blizzards service package and the user interface\\nblizzard entertainment officially unveiled the revamped battlenet 20 on march 20 2009 it later revealed further details of the battlenet revamped features at blizzcon 2009 which supported world of warcraft starcraft ii and diablo iii the original battlenet was then renamed to battlenet classic battlenet classic games use a different account system to the games on battlenet 20 \\nthe platform currently supports storefront actions social interactions and matchmaking for all of blizzards modern pc games including hearthstone heroes of the storm overwatch and  as well as various call of duty games and  from corporate sibling of blizzard entertainment activision the platform provides crossgame instant messaging and voice chat service\\nin september 2017 blizzard entertainment released the battlenet application for android and ios the app includes the ability to chat with and add friends in addition to seeing what games they are currently playing\\nhistory\\nbattlenet classic\\nwhen the service initially launched on december 31 1996 the first game using the service being diablo releasing a few days later on january 3 1997 battlenet offered only a few basic services like chatting and game listings players could connect to the service talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of diablo besides user account data no game data was stored on the battlenet servers when a player connected to a game they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game no data was sent through the battlenet servers while this made the service quick and easy to use it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally however since there was an option to create private games many players ended up playing with people they knew\\nthe release of starcraft in 1998 increased usage of the battlenet service significantly features such as ladder ranking and game filters were added to the service battlenet grew even larger after the release of the expansion pack  with tens of thousands of players logged on at any given time even in the present day starcraft battlenet was especially successful in south korea where the number of players logged on was often many times that of the united states\\nstarcraft also brought with it a new copy protection scheme using cd keys under diablo battlenet would allow any client to connect to the service with starcraft only those players with a valid and unique cd key  a generated 13digit number distributed with each boxed game  were allowed onto the service only one person could connect to battlenet using a specific cd key at a time cdkeys could also be muted unable to chat in channels or whisper voided restricted to the void channel jailed both muted and voided or banned from battlenet entirely every blizzard game since starcraft has used the cd key system to connect to battlenet starcraft brood war used as its cdkey whatever cdkey was found on the original starcraft on that computer and was thus only installable if the original was already installed with the release of the gateway system in brood war selectable regional server clusters two players can play at the same time as long as they are on different gateways given how the gateways are expectedly separate from each other each with their own games list and user accounts that are not shared across the other gateways it is still maintained that they cannot play in the same game nor chat with each other etc\\ndiablo ii was released in 2000 to much fanfare the main highlight of diablo ii as it relates to battlenet was that the game used the clientserver model the game was no longer simulated on each players computer but instead was run on blizzards server this also meant that all of the character data for the game was stored on the battlenet servers the game also has an open character feature on battlenet which stored the players character on the client this allowed players to play characters locally or on a lan and then use those same characters on battlenet however any open games played on battlenet were not protected from cheating by other players since they could have modified their characters locally diablo ii also had a unique feature that would show the players in the battlenet chat room as avatars who looked like their characters did in the game it also used a different battlenet interface than previous games where previously there were mainly only color differences there was also expanded ladder support including a hardcore ladder which listed players whose characters would be removed permanently if they died ingame again with diablo ii usage of battlenet increased steadily climbing even higher with the release of the expansion pack  in 2001\\n was released in 2002 and its expansion pack  was released in 2003 the release of these two games brought with them a number of new features to the online service the most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of anonymous matchmaking this feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill based on ranking and also wanted to play a game this allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily it also reduced wintrading where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder the matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called arranged teams in an arranged team game you could make a team with one or more friends which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank however a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated fair matchups called abusing simply by someone losing the arranged team games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally who wants to gain wins easily wont find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players automated tournaments were added in the expansion where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day in addition to the new game styles a slew of other features were added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the players number of wins a friends list and clan support\\nbattlenet 20\\nbattlenet was revamped by blizzard entertainment in 2009 and officially unveiled on march 20 2009 it was further elaborated on during blizzcon 2009 the new battlenet contains three unique sections the first allows players to connect all battlenet accounts world of warcraft characters and friends list together and integrate them into a unified single battlenet account players can also unlock achievements ingame which would in turn unlock avatars and decals which would be shown on the players profile the decals can also be seen ingame on the players units\\nthe second section consists of making battlenet into a competitive platform for players which involves a new improved matchmaking system simplifying the process of players organizing games the ladder system has also been revamped the system classifies players into certain leagues according to their level of competitiveness players would then compete against others who have a similar skill level to their own albeit across leagues there is also a special practice league to practice and hone skills where game speed is reduced and maps are designed to create a slower pace of the game the party system works similar to that of world of warcraft where players with friends would join together and enter games as a party\\nthe final section involves the new chat system which involves a new system similar to instant messaging across games players may communicate with friends across games servers and characters\\nworld of warcraft initially did not support battlenet having separate accounts from battlenet once until the revamp of battlenet on march 20 2009 which forced players to merge their world of warcraft accounts with the new battlenet accounts the features of battlenet utilized in world of warcraft include allowing players to engage in crossrealm crossfaction and crossgame chat which allows players to talk with their friends on their real id friends list from other factions other servers as well as other games such as starcraft ii and diablo iii on november 11 2009 blizzard entertainment made battlenet a mandatory feature for world of warcraft players\\nstarcraft ii was the first game to natively support the new revamped battlenet online interface it was split into three installments the base game with the subtitle  expansion pack  standalone expansion pack  and downloadable content mission packs  \\nthe new interface includes a chat service which is similar to that of instant messengers which allows players to interact across different games the platform also supports voip for players\\non may 5 2010 blizzard revealed that battlenet 20 would be integrated with social networking site facebook linking the worlds premier online gaming platform with the worlds most popular social platform\\nblizzard battlenet desktop app\\nin august 2013 blizzard entertainment

messaging it also provides access to some account management and game services blizzard launches its own crossgame voice chat service in october 2016 blizzard voice is integrated into the battlenet application\\nin february 2017 blizzard introduced the ability to obtain blizzard storefront credit by trading in wow tokens from world of warcraft bought through the use of ingame gold and initially used as a means of trading credits between players of world of warcraft these credits could be used to purchase other blizzard games or content such as card packs for hearthstone or loot boxes for overwatch\\nthe windows version of destiny 2 developed by bungie and published by corporate sibling of blizzard entertainment activision was exclusively sold and launched through the battlenet on its windows release on october 24 2017 as well as used to support the games matchmaking capabilities making it the first nonblizzard game supported by the launcher blizzard affirmed that players can use gold farming in world of warcraft to generate credit towards their blizzard account that they can use towards purchase of destiny 2 blizzard said that they are also potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future activision games to be supported by the battlenet with  scheduled for release in late 2018 as its second title for the service blizzard said it does not plan to extend similar support to other thirdparties fearing it would weaken their quality control with the product \\ndestiny 2 was removed from battlenet on october 1 2019 after bungie and activision amicably terminated the publishing deal with bungie transitioning players to use steam instead after that date\\na major user interface update for battlenet was issued in january 2021 aimed to provide better visibility

and ios the app provides simple social networking features with a users friends on battlenet including accepting and sending friend invitations and chatting with friends\\nrebranding\\nin late 2016 blizzard entertainment announced plans to rebrand battlenet according to ceo mike morhaime the company found themselves in a position where they had two competing brands  blizzard and battlenet  creating confusion for players of where to find information about their games and wanted to consolidate the branding their first step was a plan to retire the battlenet name in favor of calling service blizzard tech announced on september 21 2016 and renaming the client as the blizzard app by march 24 2017 however following this change blizzard realized that the battlenet brand had too much legacy behind it to let it go since dropping the brand created additional confusion for users this further became an issue when blizzard sought to have destiny 2 use the service as they wanted to be clear that the game was not developed by blizzard but used the battlenet framework but the blizzard app branding would not provide that clarity by august 2017 blizzard entertainment stepped back from the full rebranding and announced that going forward they would call the service and application blizzard battlenet which morhaime said was the best way they had found to combine both brands and minimize consumer confusion by february 2021 blizzard entertainment released a new interface and rebranded the application battlenet to its original name\\ndevelopment\\nsecurity\\nto help users protect their battlenet accounts blizzard entertainment implemented a twofactor authentication option for the service launched in 2008 this was initially through a separate device that could be purchased from blizzard encoded with the users credentials the device fit on a keychain and would generate pseudorandom numbers linked to the players account which they would enter when logging into battlenet to affirm their identity later blizzard introduced the battlenet mobile application for ios and android platforms in 2009 replicating the same functionality an update during june 2016 simplified the process allowing the user when logging into their battlenet account from a computer to simply press a single button on their connected mobile device to affirm their authenticity though not required to use battlenet some game aspects require the user to enable twofactor authentication through either the device or mobile app\\ngrowth history\\nby november 1997 blizzard entertainment claimed that battlenet had 22 million games played 125 million different users and averaged 3500 new users each day by april 1999 it was reported that battlenet had 23 million active users and more than 50000 concurrent users by september 2002 their active user count had jumped to 11 million by september 2004 their active user count was up to nearly 12 million spending more than 21 million hours online each day and they had an average of 200000 concurrent users with a peak concurrent user count of 400000 in 2006 blizzard claimed that battlenet when combined with the world of warcraft subscriber base was a leader of online gaming noting that even xbox live is not even close to us\\ncommunity content\\na community of developers has arisen around battlenet many unofficial clients are available for battlenet and most of the protocol used by battlenetenabled games has been reverseengineered and published by volunteers\\nalso several communication tools have been made like a whisper tool so that a player could talk to their friends even if they are in a game\\ncustom games using maps that were not made by blizzard entertainment have helped build the community and now are a substantial portion of the games played among the most popular of these games in  are tower defense maps and hero solo maps such as defense of the ancients and arena maps or pure rts games like civilization wars where the player develops their economy tech and unit diversity but the player has no control of their units\\ncontroversy\\nbnetd\\na group of gamers reverse engineered the network protocol used by battlenet and blizzard games and released a free under the gnu gpl battlenet emulation package called bnetd with bnetd a gamer is not required to use the official battlenet servers to play blizzard games\\nin february 2002 lawyers retained by blizzard entertainment threatened legal action under the digital millennium copyright act dmca against the developers of bnetd blizzard games are designed to operate online exclusively with a set of blizzardcontrolled servers collectively known as battlenet battlenet servers include a cd key check as a means of preventing software piracy\\ndespite offers from the bnetd developers to integrate blizzards cd key checking system into bnetd blizzard claims that the public availability of any such software package facilitates piracy and moved to have the bnetd project shut down under provisions of the dmca as this case is one of the first major test cases for the dmca the electronic frontier foundation became involved for a while negotiations were ongoing to resolve the case without a trial however the negotiations failed and blizzard won the case on all counts the defendants were ruled to have breached both starcrafts end user license agreement eula and the terms of use of battlenet\\nthis decision was appealed to the eighth circuit court of appeals which also ruled in favor of blizzard entertainmentvivendi on september 1 2005\\nprivacy and real id\\non july 6 2010 blizzard entertainment announced that they planned to change the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name the reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change foolhardy and an epic fail it also resulted in the largest user response ever on the blizzard forums this included personal details of a blizzard employee who gave his real name to show it wasnt a big deal shortly after revealing his real name personal information was posted that included his phone number picture age home address and other details\\nsome technology media outlets suggested the change was a good idea and would benefit both battlenet and the blizzard community others worried that blizzard would open their fans up to reallife dangers such as stalking sexual predators and employment issues since a simple google search by a users employer would reveal their online activities there was also concern that this would lead to reallife harassment and safety concerns especially for women and transgender gamers who are already harassed quite often ingame\\nblizzard entertainment initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post and that posting to the forums is optional however due to the huge negative response blizzard president michael morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on blizzards forums for the time being\\n2012 hacking\\nduring 2012 blizzard entertainment suffered a number of incidents related to security in may 2012 shortly after diablo iiis launch they discovered a number of accounts that had been hacked using traditional means through password knowledge with affected game characters being stripped of ingame possessions that could be sold for money blizzard noted at this time that those accounts affected did not use their authentication option and made changes to try to improve security such as the above authentication requirement for the games auction house a few months later on august 4 2012 blizzard reported that their battlenet servers had been hacked into with the perpetrators gaining access to some personal information including user email addresses answers to security questions and scrambled passwords but not enough for user accounts to be compromised according to blizzard blizzard entertainment required all players on battlenet in north america to change their password and suggested all users change their security questions\\nthese security breaches led to a classaction lawsuit against blizzard entertainment in november 2012 claiming that the company was making a profit from the sale of authenticator devices rather than using the money to enhance the security of their own servers and that they failed to notify affected users about the august data breach in a timely manner most of the claims in the suit were summarily dismissed in favor of blizzard entertainment in july 2013 primarily as the plaintiffs could not show any harm they suffered from these breaches and the remaining claims related to battlenet authenticator promotional claims were resolved through mediation the case was ultimately closed in february

and data speeds\\neach generation of wireless cellular technology has introduced increased bandwidth speeds and network capacity 4g users get speeds of up to 100 mbps while 3g only promised a peak speed of 14 mbps\\ntechnical overview\\nin november 2008 the international telecommunications unionradio communications sector itur specified a set of requirements for 4g standards named the international mobile telecommunications advanced imtadvanced specification setting peak speed requirements for 4g service at 100 megabits per second mbits125 megabytes per second for high mobility communication such as from trains and cars and 1 gigabit per second gbits for low mobility communication such as pedestrians and stationary users\\nsince the firstrelease versions of mobile wimax and lte support much less than 1 gbits peak bit rate they are not fully imtadvanced compliant but are often branded 4g by service providers according to operators a generation of the network refers to the deployment of a new nonbackwardcompatible technology on december 6 2010 itur recognized that these two technologies as well as other beyond3g technologies that do not fulfill the imtadvanced requirements could nevertheless be considered 4g provided they represent forerunners to imtadvanced compliant versions and a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed\\nmobile wimax release 2 also known as wirelessmanadvanced or ieee 80216m and lte advanced\\nltea are imtadvanced compliant backwards compatible versions of the above two systems standardized during the spring 2011 and promising speeds in the order of 1 gbits services were expected in 2013\\nas opposed to earlier generations a 4g system does not support traditional circuitswitched telephony service but instead relies on allinternet protocol ip based communication such as ip telephony as seen below the spread spectrum radio technology used in 3g systems is abandoned in all 4g candidate systems and replaced by ofdma multicarrier transmission and other frequencydomain equalization fde schemes making it possible to transfer very high bit rates despite extensive multipath radio propagation echoes the peak bit rate is further improved by smart antenna arrays for multipleinput multipleoutput mimo communications\\nbackground\\nin the field of mobile communications a generation generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service nonbackwardscompatible transmission technology higher peak bit rates new frequency bands wider channel frequency bandwidth in hertz and higher capacity for many simultaneous data transfers higher system spectral efficiency in bitsecondhertzsite\\nnew mobile generations have appeared about every ten years since the first move from 1981 analog 1g to digital 2g transmission in 1992 this was followed in 2001 by 3g multimedia support spread spectrum transmission and a minimum peak bit rate of 200 kbits in 20112012 to be followed by real 4g which refers to allinternet protocol ip packetswitched networks giving mobile ultrabroadband gigabit speed access\\nwhile the itu has adopted recommendations for technologies that would be used for future global communications they do not actually perform the standardization or development work themselves instead relying on the work of other standard bodies such as ieee wimax forum and 3gpp\\nin the mid1990s the itur standardization organization released the imt2000

that would offer a considerable boost until wimax 2 based on the 80216m specification and lte advanced was deployed the latters standard versions were ratified in spring 2011\\nthe first set of 3gpp requirements on lte advanced was approved in june 2008 lte advanced was standardized in 2010 as part of release 10 of the 3gpp specification\\nsome sources consider firstrelease lte and mobile wimax implementations as pre4g or near4g as they do not fully comply with the planned requirements of 1gbits for stationary reception and 100mbits for mobile\\nconfusion has been caused by some mobile carriers who have launched products advertised as 4g but which according to some sources are pre4g versions commonly referred to as 39g which do not follow the itur defined principles for 4g standards but today can be called 4g according to itur vodafone netherlands for example advertised lte as 4g while advertising lte advanced as their 4g service a common argument for branding 39g systems as newgeneration is that they use different frequency bands from 3g technologies that they are based on a new radiointerface paradigm and that the standards are not backwards compatible with 3g whilst some of the standards are forwards compatible with imt2000 compliant versions of the same standards\\nsystem standards\\nimt2000 compliant 4g standards\\nas of october 2010 itur working party 5d

the 3gpp organization to itut in the fall 2009 and expected to be released in 2013 the target of 3gpp lte advanced is to reach and surpass the itu requirements lte advanced is essentially an enhancement to lte it is not a new technology but rather an improvement on the existing lte network this upgrade path makes it more cost effective for vendors to offer lte and then upgrade to lte advanced which is similar to the upgrade from wcdma to hspa lte and lte advanced will also make use of additional spectrums and multiplexing to allow it to achieve higher data speeds coordinated

evolution lte and wimax are being vigorously promoted in the global telecommunications industry the former lte is also the most powerful 4g mobile communications leading technology and has quickly occupied the chinese market tdlte one of the two variants of the lte air interface technologies is not yet mature but many domestic and international wireless carriers are one after the other turning to tdlte\\nibms data shows that 67 of the operators are considering lte because this is the main source of their future market the above news also confirms ibms statement that while only 8 of the operators are considering the use of wimax wimax can provide the fastest network transmission to its customers on the market and could challenge lte\\ntdlte is not the first 4g wireless mobile

developed into a 4g standard\\niburst and mbwa ieee 80220 systems\\nthe iburst system or hcsdma high capacity spatial division multiple access was at an early stage considered to be a 4g predecessor it was later further developed into the mobile broadband wireless access mbwa system also known as ieee 80220\\nprincipal technologies in all candidate systems\\nkey features\\nthe following key features can be observed in all suggested 4g technologies\\nas opposed to earlier generations 4g systems do not support circuit switched telephony ieee 80220 umb and ofdm standards lack softhandover support also known as cooperative relaying\\nmultiplexing and access schemes\\nrecently new access schemes like orthogonal fdma ofdma single carrier fdma scfdma interleaved fdma and multicarrier cdma mccdma are gaining more importance for the next generation systems these are based on efficient fft algorithms and frequency domain equalization resulting in a lower number of multiplications per second they also make it possible to control the bandwidth and form the spectrum in a flexible way however they require advanced dynamic channel allocation and adaptive traffic scheduling\\nwimax is using ofdma in the downlink and in the uplink for the lte telecommunication ofdma is used for the downlink by contrast singlecarrier fdma is used for the uplink since ofdma contributes more to the papr related issues and results in nonlinear operation of amplifiers ifdma provides less power fluctuation and thus requires energyinefficient linear amplifiers similarly mccdma is in the proposal for the ieee 80220 standard these access schemes offer the same efficiencies as older technologies like cdma apart from this scalability and higher data rates can be achieved\\nthe other important advantage of the abovementioned access techniques is that they require less complexity for equalization at the receiver this is an added advantage especially in the mimo environments since the spatial multiplexing transmission of mimo systems inherently require high complexity equalization at the receiver\\nin addition to improvements in these multiplexing systems improved modulation techniques are being used whereas earlier standards largely used phaseshift keying more efficient systems such as 64qam are being proposed for use with the 3gpp long term evolution standards\\nipv6 support\\nunlike 3g which is based on two parallel infrastructures consisting of circuit switched and packet switched network nodes 4g is based on packet switching only this requires lowlatency data transmission\\nas ipv4 addresses are nearly exhausted ipv6 is essential to support the large number of wirelessenabled devices that communicate using ip by increasing the number of ip addresses available ipv6 removes the need for network address translation nat a method of sharing a limited number of addresses among a larger group of devices which has a number of problems and limitations when using ipv6 some kind of nat is still required for communication with legacy ipv4 devices that are not also ipv6connected\\n verizon has posted specifications that require any 4g devices on its network to support ipv6\\nadvanced antenna systems\\nthe performance of radio communications depends on an antenna system termed smart or intelligent antenna recently multiple antenna technologies are emerging to achieve the goal of 4g systems such as high rate high reliability and long range communications in the early 1990s to cater for the growing data rate needs of data communication many transmission schemes were proposed one technology spatial multiplexing gained importance for its bandwidth conservation and power efficiency spatial multiplexing involves deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver independent streams can then be transmitted simultaneously from all the antennas this technology called mimo as a branch of intelligent antenna multiplies the base data rate by the smaller of the number of transmit antennas or the number of receive antennas apart from this the reliability in transmitting high speed data in the fading channel can be improved by using more antennas at the transmitter or at the receiver this is called transmit or receive diversity both transmitreceive diversity and transmit spatial multiplexing are categorized into the spacetime coding techniques which does not necessarily require the channel knowledge at the transmitter the other category is closedloop multiple antenna technologies which require channel knowledge at the transmitter\\nopenwireless architecture and softwaredefined radio sdr\\none of the key technologies for 4g and beyond is called open wireless architecture owa supporting multiple wireless air interfaces in an open architecture platform\\nsdr is one form of open wireless architecture owa since 4g is a collection of wireless standards the final form of a 4g device will constitute various standards this can be efficiently realized using sdr technology which is categorized to the area of the radio convergence\\nhistory of 4g and pre4g technologies\\nthe 4g system was originally envisioned by the darpa the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa selected the distributed architecture and endtoend internet protocol ip and believed at an early stage in peertopeer networking in which every mobile device would be both a transceiver and a router for other devices in the network eliminating the spokeandhub weakness of 2g and 3g cellular systems since the 25g gprs system cellular systems have provided dual infrastructures packet switched nodes for data services and circuit switched nodes for voice calls in 4g systems the circuitswitched infrastructure is abandoned and only a packetswitched network is provided while 25g and 3g systems require both packetswitched and circuitswitched network nodes ie two infrastructures in parallel this means that in 4g traditional voice calls are replaced by ip telephony\\nsince 2009 the ltestandard has strongly evolved over the years resulting in many deployments by various operators across the globe for an overview of commercial lte networks and their respective historic development see list of lte networks among the vast range of deployments many operators are considering the deployment and operation of lte networks a compilation of planned lte deployments can be found at list of planned lte networks\\ndisadvantages\\n4g introduces a potential inconvenience for those who travel internationally or wish to switch carriers in order to make and receive 4g voice calls the subscriber handset must not only have a matching frequency band and in some cases require unlocking it must also have the matching enablement settings for the local carrier andor country while a phone purchased from a given carrier can be expected to work with that carrier making 4g voice calls on another carriers network including international roaming may be impossible without a software update specific to the local carrier and the phone model in question which may or may not be available although fallback to 3g for voice calling may still be possible if a 3g network is available with a matching frequency band\\nbeyond 4g research\\na major issue in 4g systems is to make the high bit rates available in a larger portion of the cell especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations in current research this issue is addressed by macrodiversity techniques also known as group cooperative relay and also by beamdivision multiple access bdma\\npervasive networks are an amorphous and at present entirely hypothetical concept where the user can be simultaneously connected to several wireless access technologies and can seamlessly move between them see vertical handoff ieee 80221 these access technologies can be wifi umts edge or any other future access technology included in this concept is also smartradio also known as cognitive radio technology to efficiently manage spectrum use and transmission power as well as the use of mesh routing protocols to create a pervasive

'label': 'Software', 'text': 'postgresql   also known as postgres is a free and opensource relational database management system rdbms emphasizing extensibility and sql compliance it was originally named postgres referring to its origins as a successor to the ingres database developed at the university of california berkeley in 1996 the project was renamed to postgresql to reflect its support for sql after a review in 2007 the development team decided to keep the name postgresql and the alias postgres\\npostgresql features transactions with atomicity consistency isolation durability acid properties automatically updatable views materialized views triggers foreign keys and stored procedures it is designed to handle a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses or web services with many concurrent users it is the default database for macos server and is also available for windows linux freebsd and openbsd\\nhistory\\npostgresql evolved from the ingres project at the university of california berkeley in 1982 the leader of the ingres team michael stonebraker left berkeley to make a proprietary version of ingres he returned to berkeley in 1985 and began a postingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s he won the turing award in 2014 for these and other projects and techniques pioneered in them\\nthe new project postgres aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types these features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships something used widely but maintained entirely by the user in postgres the database understood relationships and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules postgres used many of the ideas of ingres but not its code\\nstarting in 1986 published papers described the basis of the system and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 acm sigmod conference the team released version 1 to a small number of users in june 1989 followed by version 2 with a rewritten rules system in june 1990 version 3 released in 1991 again rewrote the rules system and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine by 1993 the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features after releasing version 42 on june 30 1994 primarily a cleanup the project ended berkeley released postgres under an mit license variant which enabled other developers to use the code for any use at the time postgres used an ingresinfluenced postquel query language interpreter which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor \\nin 1994 berkeley graduate students andrew yu and jolly chen replaced the postquel query language interpreter with one for the sql query language creating postgres95 the monitor console was also replaced by psql yu and chen announced the first version 001 to beta testers on may 5 1995 version 10 of postgres95 was announced on september 5 1995 with a more liberal license that enabled the software to be freely modifiable\\non july 8 1996 marc fournier at huborg networking services provided the first nonuniversity development server for the opensource development effort with the participation of bruce momjian and vadim b mikheev work began to stabilize the code inherited from berkeley\\nin 1996 the project was renamed to postgresql to reflect its support for sql the online presence at the website postgresqlorg began on october 22 1996 the first postgresql release formed version 60 on january 29 1997 since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as the postgresql global development group\\nthe project continues to make releases available under its free and opensource software postgresql license code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors support companies and opensource programmers\\nmultiversion concurrency control mvcc\\npostgresql manages concurrency through multiversion concurrency control mvcc which gives each transaction a snapshot of the database allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions this largely eliminates the need for read locks and ensures the database maintains acid principles postgresql offers three levels of transaction isolation read committed repeatable read and serializable because postgresql is immune to dirty reads requesting a read uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead postgresql supports full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation ssi method\\nstorage and replication\\nreplication\\npostgresql includes builtin binary replication based on shipping the changes writeahead logs wal to replica nodes asynchronously with the ability to run readonly queries against these replicated nodes this allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master increasing load\\npostgresql includes builtin synchronous replication that ensures that for each write transaction the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log unlike other database systems the durability of a transaction whether it is asynchronous or synchronous can be specified perdatabase peruser persession or even pertransaction this can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby\\nstandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication the first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server when this fails the system fails over to the next in line\\nsynchronous multimaster replication is not included in the postgresql core postgresxc which is based on postgresql provides scalable synchronous multimaster replication it is licensed under the same license as postgresql a related project is called postgresxl postgresr is yet another fork bidirectional replication bdr is an asynchronous multimaster replication system for postgresql\\ntools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier\\nseveral asynchronous triggerbased replication packages are available these remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate\\nindexes\\npostgresql includes builtin support for regular btree and hash table indexes and four index access methods generalized search trees gist generalized inverted indexes gin spacepartitioned gist spgist and block range indexes brin in addition userdefined index methods can be created although this is quite an involved process indexes in postgresql also support the following features\\nschemas\\nin postgresql a schema holds all objects except for roles and tablespaces schemas effectively act like namespaces allowing objects of the same name to coexist in the same database by default newly created databases have a schema called public but any further schemas can be added and the public schema isnt mandatory\\na setting determines the order in which postgresql checks schemas for unqualified objects those without a prefixed schema by default it is set to  refers to the currently connected database user this default can be set on a database or role level but as it is a session parameter it can be freely changed even multiple times during a client session affecting that session only\\nnonexistent schemas listed in searchpath are silently skipped during objects lookup\\nnew objects are created in whichever valid schema one that presently exists appears first in the searchpath\\ndata types\\na wide variety of native data types are supported including\\nin addition users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via postgresqls indexing infrastructures gist gin spgist examples of these include the geographic information system gis data types from the postgis project for postgresql\\nthere is also a data type called a domain which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain this means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain\\na data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types these can be discrete ranges eg all integer values 1 to 10 or continuous ranges eg any time between and  the builtin range types available include ranges of integers big integers decimal numbers time stamps with and without time zone and dates\\ncustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available such as ip address ranges using the inet type as a base or float ranges using the float data type as a base range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the  and  characters respectively eg represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9 range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap containment right of etc\\nuserdefined objects\\nnew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created including\\ninheritance\\ntables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a parent table data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables unless data is selected from the parent table using the only keyword ie  adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table\\ninheritance can be used to implement table partitioning using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables\\n this feature is not fully supported yet in particular table constraints are not currently inheritable all check constraints and notnull constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children other types of constraints unique primary key and foreign key constraints are not inherited\\ninheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in entity relationship diagrams erds directly into the postgresql database\\ncontrol and connectivity\\nforeign data wrappers\\npostgresql can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers fdws\\nthese can take the form of any data source such as a file system another relational database management system rdbms or a web service this means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables and even join multiple datasources together\\ninterfaces\\nfor connecting to applications postgresql includes the builtin interfaces libpq the official c application interface and ecpg an embedded c system thirdparty libraries for connecting to postgresql are available for many programming languages including c java julia python nodejs go and rust\\nprocedural languages\\nprocedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines functions often called stored procedures these functions can be used to build database triggers functions invoked on modification of certain data and custom data types and aggregate functions procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function using a do command at sql level\\nlanguages are divided into two groups procedures written in safe languages are sandboxed and can be safely created and used by any user procedures written in unsafe languages can only be created by superusers because they allow bypassing a databases security restrictions but can also access sources external to the database some languages like perl provide both safe and unsafe versions\\npostgresql has builtin support for three procedural languages\\nin addition postgresql allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions three language extensions are included with postgresql to support perl tcl and python for python discontinued is used by default  or  even in postgresql 14 is also supported by choosing the language  external projects provide support for many other languages including pljava javascript plv8 pljulialtref namepljuliagtltrefgt plr plruby and others\\ntriggers\\ntriggers are events triggered by the action of sql data manipulation language dml statements for example an insert statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid most triggers are only activated by either insert or update statements\\ntriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables triggers can be percolumn and conditional in that update triggers can target specific columns of a table and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the triggers where clause triggers can be attached to views by using the instead of condition multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order in addition to calling functions written in the native plpgsql triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like plpython or plperl\\nasynchronous notifications\\npostgresql provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the notify listen and unlisten commands a session can issue a notify command along with the userspecified channel and an optional payload to mark a particular event occurring other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a listen command which can listen to a particular channel this functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed and reducing unnecessary overhead notifications are fully transactional in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed this eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back\\nmany connectors for postgresql provide support for this notification system including libpq jdbc npgsql psycopg and nodejs so it can be used by external applications\\npostgresql can act as an effective persistent pubsub server or job server by combining listen with for update skip locked\\nrules\\nrules allow the query tree of an incoming query to be rewritten query rewrite rules are attached to a tableclass and rewrite the incoming dml select insert update andor delete into one or more queries that either replace the original dml statement or execute in addition to it query rewrite occurs after dml statement parsing but before query planning\\nconcurrency model\\npostgresql server is processbased not threaded and uses one operating system process per database session multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available cpus by the operating system many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes taking advantage of multiple cpus or cores client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread\\nsecurity\\npostgresql manages its internal security on a perrole basis a role is generally regarded to be a user a role that can log in or a group a role of which other roles are members permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level and can also allowprevent the creation of new objects at the database schema or table levels\\npostgresqls security label feature extension to sql standards allows for additional security with a bundled loadable module that supports labelbased mandatory access control mac based on securityenhanced linux selinux security policy\\npostgresql natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms including\\nthe gssapi sspi kerberos peer ident and certificate methods can also use a specified map file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user\\nthese methods are specified in the clusters hostbased authentication configuration file pghbaconf which determines what connections are allowed this allows control over which user can connect to which database where they can connect from ip address ip address range domain socket which authentication system will be enforced and whether the connection must use transport layer security tls\\nstandards compliance\\npostgresql claims high but not complete conformance with the latest sql standard for version 13 in september 2020 postgresql conforms to at least 170 of the 179 mandatory features for core conformance and no other databases fully conformed to it one exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names in postgresql they are folded internally to lower case characters whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case thus should be equivalent to not according to the standard\\nbenchmarks and performance\\nmany informal performance studies of postgresql have been done performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 81 simple benchmarks between version 80 and version 84 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on readonly workloads and at least 75 times faster on both read and write workloads\\nthe first industrystandard and peervalidated benchmark was completed in june 2007 using the sun java system application server proprietary version of glassfish 90 platform edition ultrasparc t1based sun fire server and postgresql 82 this result of 77814 specjappserver2004 jopsstandard compares favourably with the 874 jopsstandard with oracle 10 on an itaniumbased hpux system\\nin august 2007 sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 81373 specjappserver2004 jopsstandard with the system under test at a reduced price the priceperformance improved from 8498jops to 7057jops\\nthe default configuration of postgresql uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performancecritical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting this limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory postgresqlorg provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki\\nin april 2012 robert haas of enterprisedb demonstrated postgresql 92s linear cpu scalability using a server with 64 cores\\nmatloob khushi

apple macintosh and apple iigs computers it is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the world wide web\\nhypercard combines a flatfile database with a graphical flexible usermodifiable interface hypercard includes a builtin programming language called hypertalk for manipulating data and the user interface\\nthis combination of features  a database with simple form layout flexible support for graphics and ease of programming  suits hypercard for many different projects such as rapid application development of applications and databases interactive applications with no database requirements command and control systems and many examples in the demoscene\\nhypercard was originally released in 1987 for 4995 and was included free with all new macs sold then it was withdrawn from sale in march 2004 having received its final update in 1998 upon the return of steve jobs to apple hypercard was not ported to mac os x but can run in the classic environment on those mac os x that support it\\noverview\\ndesign\\nhypercard is based on the concept of a stack of virtual cards cards hold data just as they would in a rolodex cardfiling device each card contains a set of interactive objects including text fields check boxes buttons and similar common graphical user interface gui elements users browse the stack by navigating from card to card using builtin navigation features a powerful search mechanism or through usercreated scripts\\nusers build or modify stacks by adding new cards they place gui objects on the cards using an interactive layout engine based on a simple draganddrop interface also hypercard includes prototype or template cards called backgrounds when new cards are created they can refer to one of these background cards which causes all of the objects on the background to be copied onto the new card this way a stack of cards with a common layout and functionality can be created the layout engine is similar in concept to a form as used in most rapid application development rad environments such as borland delphi and microsoft visual basic and visual studio\\nthe database features of the hypercard system are based on the storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack the database does not exist as a separate system within the hypercard stack no database engine or similar construct exists instead the state of any object in the system is considered to be live and editable at any time from the hypercard runtimes perspective there is no difference between moving a text field on the card and typing into it both operations simply change the state of the target object within the stack such changes are immediately saved when complete so typing into a field causes that text to be stored to the stacks physical file the system operates in a largely stateless fashion with no need to save during operation this is in common with many databaseoriented systems although somewhat different from documentbased applications\\nthe final key element in hypercard is the script a single codecarrying element of every object within the stack the script is a text field whose contents are interpreted in the hypertalk language like any other property the script of any object can be edited at any time and changes are saved as soon as they were complete when the user invokes actions in the gui like clicking on a button or typing into a field these actions are translated into events by the hypercard runtime the runtime then examines the script of the object that is the target of the event like a button to see if its script object contains the events code called a handler if it does the hypertalk engine runs the handler if it does not the runtime examines other objects in the visual hierarchy\\nthese concepts make up the majority of the hypercard system stacks backgrounds and cards provide a formlike gui system the stack file provides object persistence and databaselike functionality and hypertalk allows handlers to be written for gui events unlike the majority of rad or database systems of the era however hypercard combines all of these features both userfacing and developerfacing in a single application this allows rapid turnaround and immediate prototyping possibly without any coding allowing users to author custom solutions to problems with their own personalized interface empowerment became a catchword as this possibility was embraced by the macintosh community as was the phrase programming for the rest of us that is anyone not just professional programmers\\nit is this combination of features that also makes hypercard a powerful hypermedia system users can build backgrounds to suit the needs of some system say a rolodex and use simple hypertalk commands to provide buttons to move from place to place within the stack or provide the same navigation system within the data elements of the ui like text fields using these features it is easy to build linked systems similar to hypertext links on the web unlike the web programming placement and browsing are all the same tool similar systems have been created for html but traditional web services are considerably more heavyweight\\nhypertalk\\nhypercard contains an object oriented scripting language called hypertalk which was noted for having a syntax resembling casual english language hypertalk language features were predetermined by the hypercard environment although they could be extended by the use of externals functions xfcn and commands xcmd written in a compiled language the weakly typed hypertalk supports most standard programming structures such as ifthen and repeat hypertalk is verbose hence its ease of use and readability hypertalk code segments are referred to as scripts a term that is considered less daunting to beginning programmers\\nexternals\\nhypercard can be extended significantly through the use of external command xcmd and external function xfcn modules these are code libraries packaged in a resource fork that integrate into either the system generally or the hypertalk language specifically this is an early example of the plugin concept unlike conventional plugins these do not require separate installation before they are available for use they can be included in a stack where they are directly available to scripts in that stack\\nduring hypercards peak popularity in the late 1980s a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals such as hypertalk compilers graphing systems database access internet connectivity and animation oracle offered an xcmd that allows hypercard to directly query oracle databases on any platform superseded by oracle card beehive technologies offered a hardware interface that allows the computer to control external devices connected via the apple desktop bus adb this instrument can read the state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices\\nexternals allow access to the macintosh toolbox which contains many lowerlevel commands and functions not native to hypertalk such as control of the serial and adb ports\\nhistory\\ndevelopment\\nhypercard was created by bill atkinson following an lsd trip work for it began in march 1985 under the name of wildcard hence its creator code of wild in 1986 dan winkler began work on hypertalk and the name was changed to hypercard for trademark reasons it was released on 11 august 1987 for the first day of the macworld conference amp expo in boston with the understanding that atkinson would give hypercard to apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all macs apple timed its release to coincide with the macworld conference amp expo in boston massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity\\nlaunch\\nhypercard was successful almost instantly the apple programmers and developers association apda said hypercard has been an informational feeding frenzy from august 1987 when it was announced to october our phones never stopped ringing it was a zoo within a few months of release there were multiple hypercard books and a 50 disk set of public domain stacks apples project managers found hypercard was being used by a huge number of people internally and externally bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in demonstrating its wide variety of users since it was also free it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software apple and its mainstream developers understood that hypercards user empowerment could reduce the sales of ordinary shrinkwrapped products stewart alsop ii speculated that hypercard might replace finder as the shell of the macintosh graphical user interface\\nhypercard 20\\nin late 1989 kevin calhoun then a hypercard engineer at apple led an effort to upgrade the program this resulted in hypercard 20 released in 1990 the new version included an onthefly compiler that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code a new debugger and many improvements to the underlying hypertalk language\\nat the same time hypercard 20 was being developed a separate group within apple developed and in 1991 released hypercard iigs a version of hypercard for the apple iigs system aimed mainly at the education market hypercard iigs has roughly the same feature set as the 1x versions of macintosh hypercard while adding support for the color graphics abilities of the iigs although stacks hypercard program documents are not binarycompatible a translator program another hypercard stack allows them to be moved from one platform to the other\\nthen apple decided that most of its application software packages including hypercard would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called claris many of the hypercard developers chose to stay at apple rather than move to claris causing the development team to be split claris attempted to create a business model where hypercard could also generate revenues at first the freelydistributed versions of hypercard shipped with authoring disabled early versions of claris hypercard contain an easter egg typing magic into the message box converts the player into a full hypercard authoring environment when this trick became nearly universal they wrote a new version hypercard player which apple distributed with the macintosh operating system while claris sold the full version commercially many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the mac\\neven after hypercard was generating revenue claris did little to market it development continued with minor upgrades and the first failed attempt to create a third generation of hypercard during this period hypercard began losing market share without several important basic features hypercard authors began moving to systems such as supercard and macromedia authorware nonetheless hypercard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications from the game the manhole an earlier effort by the creators of myst to corporate information services\\napple eventually folded claris back into the parent company returning hypercard to apples core engineering group in 1992 apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of hypercard 22 and included licensed versions of color tools and addmotion ii adding support for color pictures and animations however these tools are limited and often cumbersome to use because hypercard 20 lacks true internal color support\\nhypercard 30\\nseveral attempts were made to restart hypercard development once it returned to apple because of the products widespread use as a multimediaauthoring tool it was rolled into the quicktime group a new effort to allow hypercard to create quicktime interactive qti movies started once again under the direction of kevin calhoun qti extended quicktimes core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a lowlevel programming language based on 68000 assembly language the resulting hypercard 30 was first presented in 1996 when an alphaquality version was shown to developers at apples annual apple worldwide developers conference wwdc under the leadership of dan crow development continued through the late 1990s with public demos showing many popular features such as color support internet connectivity and the ability to play hypercard stacks which were now special quicktime movies in a web browser development upon hypercard 30 stalled when the quicktime team was focused away from developing quicktime interactive to the streaming features of quicktime 40 in 1998 steve jobs disliked the software because atkinson had chosen to stay at apple to finish it instead of joining jobs at next and according to atkinson it had sculleys stink all over it in 2000 the hypercard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after jobs decided to abandon the product calhoun and crow both left apple shortly after in 2001\\nits final release was in 1998 and it was totally discontinued in march 2004\\nhypercard runs natively only in the classic mac os but it can still be used in mac os xs classic mode on powerpc based machines g5 and earlier the last functional native hypercard authoring environment is classic mode in mac os x 104 tiger on powerpcbased machines\\napplications\\nhypercard has been used for a range of hypertext and artistic purposes before the advent of powerpoint hypercard was often used as a generalpurpose presentation program examples of hypercard applications include simple databases choose your own adventuretype games and educational teaching aids\\ndue to its rapid application design facilities hypercard was also often used for prototyping applications and sometimes even for version 10 implementations inside apple the quicktime team was one of hypercards biggest customers\\nhypercard has lower hardware requirements than macromedia director several commercial software products were created in hypercard most notably the original version of the graphic adventure game myst the voyager companys expanded books multimedia cdroms of beethovens ninth symphony cdrom a hard days night by the beatles and the voyager macbeth an early electronic edition of the whole earth catalog was implemented in hypercard and stored on cdrom\\nthe prototype and demo of the popular game you dont know jack was written in hypercard the french auto manufacturer renault used it to control their inventory system\\nin quebec canada hypercard was used to control a robot arm used to insert and retrieve video disks at the national film board cinrobothque\\nhypercard was used to prototype a fully functional prototype of sidoci one of the first experiments in the world to develop an integrated electronic patient record system and was heavily used by montral consulting firm dmr to demonstrate how a typical day in the life of a patient about to get surgery would look like in a paperless age\\nactivision which was until then mainly a game company saw hypercard as an entry point into the business market changing its name to mediagenic it published several major hypercardbased applications most notably danny goodmans focal point a personal information manager and reports for hypercard a program by nine to five software that allows users to treat hypercard as a full database system with robust information viewing and printing features\\nthe hypercardinspired supercard for a while included the roadster plugin that allowed stacks to be placed inside web pages and viewed by web browsers with an appropriate browser plugin there was even a windows version of this plugin allowing computers other than macintoshes to use the plugin\\nexploits\\nthe first hypercard virus was discovered in belgium and the netherlands in april 1991\\nbecause hypercard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening it was also one of the first applications susceptible to macro viruses the merryxmas virus was discovered in early 1993 by ken dunham two years before the concept virus very few viruses were based on hypercard and their overall impact was minimal\\nreception\\ncomputes apple applications in 1987 stated that hypercard may make macintosh the personal computer of choice while noting that its large memory requirement made it best suited for computers with 2\\xa0mb of memory and hard drives the magazine predicted that the smallest programming shop should be able to turn out stackware especially for using cdroms compute predicted in 1988 that most future mac software would be developed using hypercard if only because using it was so addictive that developers wont be able to tear themselves away from it long enough to create anything else byte in 1989 listed it as among the excellence winners of the byte awards while stating that like any first entry it has some flaws the magazine wrote that hypercard opened up a new category of software and praised apple for bundling it with every mac in 2001 steve wozniak called hypercard the best program ever written\\nlegacy\\nhypercard is one of the first products that made use of and popularized the hypertext concept to a large popular base of users\\njakob nielsen has pointed out that hypercard was really only a hypermedia program since its links started from regions on a card not text objects actual htmlstyle text hyperlinks were possible in later versions but were awkward to implement and seldom used deena larsen programmed links into hypercard for marble springs bill atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of networkoriented stacks instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine hypercard could have become the first web browser\\nhypercard saw a loss in popularity with the growth of the world wide web since the web could handle and deliver data in much the same way as hypercard without being limited to files on a local hard disk hypercard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both http through its influence on tim bernerslees colleague robert cailliau and javascript whose creator brendan eich was inspired by hypertalk it was also a key inspiration for violawww

{'title': 'DirectX', 'label': 'Software', 'text': 'microsoft directx is a collection of application programming interfaces apis for handling tasks related to multimedia especially game programming and video on microsoft platforms originally the names of these apis all began with direct such as direct3d directdraw directmusic directplay directsound and so forth the name directx was coined as a shorthand term for all of these apis the x standing in for the particular api names and soon became the name of the collection when microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console the x was used as the basis of the name xbox to indicate that the console was based on directx technology the x initial has been carried forward in the naming of apis designed for the xbox such as xinput and the crossplatform audio creation tool xact while the directx pattern has been continued for windows apis such as direct2d and directwrite\\ndirect3d the 3d graphics api within directx is widely used in the development of video games for microsoft windows and the xbox line of consoles direct3d is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as cadcam engineering as direct3d is the most widely publicized component of directx it is common to see the names directx and direct3d used interchangeably\\nthe directx software development kit sdk consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding originally the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user windows 95 did not launch with directx but directx was included with windows 95 oem service release 2 windows 98 and windows nt 40 both shipped with directx as has every version of windows released since the sdk is available as a free download while the runtimes are proprietary closedsource software source code is provided for most of the sdk samples starting with the release of windows 8 developer preview directx sdk has been integrated into windows sdk\\ndevelopment history\\nin late 1994 microsoft was ready to release windows 95 its next operating system an important factor in the value consumers would place on it was the programs that would be able to run on it microsoft employee alex st john had been in discussions with various game developers asking how likely they would be to bring their msdos games to windows 95 and found the responses mostly negative programmers had found the windows environment more difficult to develop for compared to msdos or other gaming platforms there were also strong fears of compatibility a notable case of this was from disneys animated storybook the lion king which was based on the wing programming interface due to numerous incompatible graphics drivers from new compaq computers that were not tested with the wing interface which came bundled with the game it crashed so frequently on many desktop systems that parents had flooded disneys callin help lines\\nst john recognized the resistances for game development under windows would be a limitation and recruited two additional engineers craig eisler and eric engstrom to develop a better solution to get more programmers to develop games for windows the project was codenamed the manhattan project as in relation to the world war ii project of the same name the idea was to displace the japanesedeveloped video game consoles with personal computers running microsofts operating system it had initially used the radiation symbol as its logo but microsoft asked the team to change the logo management did not agree to the project as they were already writing off windows as a gaming platform but the three committed towards this projects development their rebellious nature led brad silverberg the senior vice president of microsofts office products to name the trio the beastie boys\\nmost of the work by the three was done among other assigned projects starting near the end of 1994 within four months and with input from several hardware manufacturers the team had developed the first set of application programming interfaces apis which they presented at the 1995 game developers conference the sdk included libraries such as directdraw for graphic routines directsound for audio and directplay for networking communications the direct part of the library was named as these routines typically bypassed core windows 95 routines and accessed the computer hardware directly though the team had named it the game sdk software development kit the name directx came from one journalist that had mocked the naming scheme of the various libraries the team opted to continue to use that naming scheme and call the project directx\\nthe first version of directx was released in september 1995 as the windows games sdk it was the win32 replacement for the dci and wing apis for windows 31 directx allowed all versions of microsoft windows starting with windows 95 to incorporate highperformance multimedia eisler wrote about the frenzy to build directx 1 through 5 in his blog\\nto get more developers on board directx microsoft approached id softwares john carmack and offered to port doom and doom 2 from msdos to directx free of charge with id retaining all publishing rights to the game carmack agreed and microsofts gabe newell led the porting project the first game was released as doom 95 in august 1996 the first published directx game microsoft promoted the game heavily with bill gates appearing in ads for the title\\ndirectx 20 became a component of windows itself with the releases of windows 95 osr2 and windows nt 40 in mid1996 since windows 95 was itself still new and few games had been released for it microsoft engaged in heavy promotion of directx to developers who were generally distrustful of microsofts ability to build a gaming platform in windows alex st john the evangelist for directx staged an elaborate event at the 1996 computer game developers conference which game developer jay barnson described as a roman theme including real lions togas and something resembling an indoor carnival it was at this event that microsoft first introduced direct3d and directplay and demonstrated multiplayer mechwarrior 2 being played over the internet\\nthe directx team faced the challenging task of testing each directx release against an array of computer hardware and software a variety of different graphics cards audio cards motherboards cpus input devices games and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release the directx team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with directx\\nprior to directx microsoft had included opengl on their windows nt platform at the time opengl required highend hardware and was focused on engineering and cad uses direct3d was intended to be a microsoft controlled alternative to opengl focused initially on game use as 3d gaming grew opengl developed to include better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia applications like games giving developers choice between using opengl or direct3d as the 3d graphics api for their applications at that point a battle began between supporters of the crossplatform opengl and the windowsonly direct3d incidentally opengl was supported at microsoft by the directx team if a developer chose to use opengl 3d graphics api the other apis of directx are often combined with opengl in computer games because opengl does not include all of directxs functionality such as sound or joystick support\\nin a consolespecific version directx was used as a basis for microsofts xbox xbox 360 and xbox one console api the api was developed jointly between microsoft and nvidia which developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original xbox the xbox api was similar to directx version 81 but is nonupdateable like other console technologies the xbox was code named directxbox but this was shortened to xbox for its commercial name\\nin 2002 microsoft released directx 9 with support for the use of much longer shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 20 microsoft has continued to update the directx suite since then introducing shader model 30 in directx 90c released in august 2004\\nas of april 2005 directshow was removed from directx and moved to the microsoft platform sdk instead\\ndirectx has been confirmed to be present in microsofts windows phone 8\\nrealtime raytracing was announced as dxr in 2018\\nlogos\\nthe original logo resembled a deformed radiation warning symbol controversially the original name for the directx project was the manhattan project a reference to the us nuclear weapons initiative alex st john head of microsoft directx evangelism at the time claims that the connotation of the ultimate outcome of the manhattan project the nuclear bombing of japan is intentional and that directx and its sister project the xbox which shares a similar logo were meant to displace japanese videogamemakers from their dominance of the video game industry however microsoft publicly denies this account instead claiming that the logo is merely an artistic design\\ncomponents\\ndirectx is composed of multiple apis\\nmicrosoft has deprecated the following components\\ndirectx functionality is provided in the form of comstyle objects and interfaces additionally while not directx components themselves managed objects have been built on top of some parts of directx such as managed direct3d and the xna graphics library on top of direct3d 9\\nmicrosoft distributes debugging tool for directx called pix\\nversions\\ndirectx 9\\ndirectx 9 was released in 2002 for windows 98 me and xp and currently is supported by all subsequent versions microsoft continues to make changes in directx 90c causing support to be dropped for some of the aforementioned operating systems as of january 2007 windows 2000 or xp is required this also introduced shader model 20 containing pixel shader 20 and vertex shader 20 windows xp sp2 and newer include directx 90c but may require a newer directx runtime redistributable installation for directx 90c applications compiled with the february 2005 directx 90 sdk or newer\\ndirectx 10\\na major update to directx api directx 10 ships with and is only available with windows vista and later previous versions of windows such as windows xp are not able to run directx 10exclusive applications rather programs that are run on a windows xp system with directx 10 hardware simply resort to the directx 90c code path the latest available for windows xp computers\\nchanges for directx 10 were extensive many former parts of directx api were deprecated in the latest directx sdk and are preserved for compatibility only directinput was deprecated in favor of xinput directsound was deprecated in favor of the crossplatform audio creation tool system xact and additionally lost support for hardware accelerated audio since the vista audio stack renders sound in software on the cpu the directplay dplaydll was also removed and was replaced with dplayxdll games that rely on this dll must duplicate it and rename it to dplaydll\\nin order to achieve backwards compatibility directx in windows vista contains several versions of direct3d\\ndirect3d 101 is an incremental update of direct3d 100 which shipped with and required windows vista service pack 1 this release mainly sets a few more image quality standards for graphics vendors while giving developers more control over image quality it also adds support for cube map arrays separate blend modes permrt coverage mask export from a pixel shader ability to run pixel shader per sample access to multisampled depth buffers and requires that the video card supports shader model 41 or higher and 32bit floatingpoint operations direct3d 101 still fully supports direct3d 10 hardware but in order to utilize all of the new features updated hardware is required\\ndirectx 11\\nmicrosoft unveiled directx 11 at the gamefest 08 event in seattle with the major scheduled features including gpgpu support directcompute and direct3d 11 with tessellation support and improved multithreading support to assist video game developers in developing games that better utilize multicore processors direct3d 11 runs on windows vista windows 7 windows 8 and windows 10 parts of the new api such as multithreaded resource handling can be supported on direct3d 910101class hardware hardware tessellation and shader model 50 require direct3d 11 supporting hardware microsoft has since released the direct3d 11 technical preview direct3d 11 is a strict superset of direct3d 101  all hardware and api features of version 101 are retained and new features are added only when necessary for exposing new functionality this helps to keep backwards compatibility with previous versions of directx\\nmicrosoft released the final platform update for windows vista on october 27 2009 which was 5 days after the initial release of windows 7 launched with direct3d 11 as a base standard\\nsince then four updates for directx 11 were released\\ndirectx 12\\ndirectx 12 was announced by microsoft at gdc on march 20 2014 and was officially launched alongside windows 10 on july 29 2015\\nthe primary feature highlight for the new release of directx was the introduction of advanced lowlevel programming apis for direct3d 12 which can reduce driver overhead developers are now able to implement their own command lists and buffers to the gpu allowing for more efficient resource utilization through parallel computation lead developer max mcmullen stated that the main goal of direct3d 12 is to achieve consolelevel efficiency on phone tablet and pc the release of direct3d 12 comes alongside other initiatives for lowoverhead graphics apis including amds mantle for amd graphics cards apples metal for ios and macos and khronos groups crossplatform vulkan\\nmultiadapter support will feature in directx 12 allowing developers to utilize multiple gpus on a system simultaneously multigpu support was previously dependent on vendor implementations such as amd crossfirex or nvidia sli\\ndirectx 12 is supported on all fermi and later nvidia gpus on amds gcnbased chips and on intels haswell and later processors graphics units\\nat siggraph 2014 intel released a demo showing a computer generated asteroid field in which directx 12 was claimed to be 5070 more efficient than directx 11 in rendering speed and cpu power consumption\\nashes of the singularity was the first publicly available game to utilize directx 12 testing by ars technica in august 2015 revealed slight performance regressions in directx 12 over directx 11 mode for the nvidia geforce 980 ti whereas the amd radeon r9 290x achieved consistent performance improvements of up to 70 under directx 12 and in some scenarios the amd outperformed the more powerful nvidia under directx 12 the performance discrepancies may be due to poor nvidia driver optimizations for directx 12 or even hardware limitations of the card which was optimized for directx 11 serial execution however the exact cause remains unclear\\nthe performance improvements of directx 12 on the xbox are not as substantial as on the pc\\nin march 2018 directx raytracing dxr was announced capable of realtime raytracing on supported hardware and the dxr api was added in the windows 10 october 2018 update\\nin 2019 microsoft announced the arrival of directx 12 to windows 7 but only as a plugin for certain game titles\\ndirectx 12 ultimate\\nmicrosoft revealed directx 12 ultimate in march 2020 directx 12 ultimate will unify to a common library on both windows 10 computers and the xbox series x and other ninthgeneration xbox consoles among the new features in ultimate includes directx raytracing 11 variable rate shading which gives programmers control over the level of detail of shading depending on design choices mesh shaders and sampler feedback\\nversion history\\nthe version number as reported by microsofts dxdiag tool version 40900000900 and higher use the xxxxxxxxxxx format for version numbers however the directx and windows xp msdn page claims that the registry always has been in the xxxxxxxxx format therefore when the above table lists a version as 409000904 microsofts dxdiag tool may have it as 40900000904\\ncompatibility\\nvarious releases of windows have included and supported various versions of directx allowing newer versions of the operating system to continue running applications designed for earlier versions of directx until those versions can be gradually phased out in favor of newer apis drivers and hardware\\napis such as direct3d and directsound need to interact with hardware and they do this through a device driver hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular directx versions device driver interface or ddi and test each individual piece of hardware to make them directx compatible some hardware devices have only directx compatible drivers in other words one must install directx in order to use that hardware early versions of directx included an uptodate library of all of the directx compatible drivers currently available this practice was stopped however in favor of the webbased windows update driverupdate system which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware rather than the entire library\\nprior to directx 10 directx runtime was designed to be backward compatible with older drivers meaning that newer versions of the apis were designed to interoperate with older drivers written against a previous versions ddi the application programmer had to query the available hardware capabilities using a complex system of cap bits each tied to a particular hardware feature direct3d 7 and earlier would work on any version of the ddi direct3d 8 requires a minimum ddi level of 6 and direct3d 9 requires a minimum ddi level of 7\\nhowever the direct3d 10 runtime in windows vista cannot run on older hardware drivers due to the significantly updated ddi which requires a unified feature set and abandons the use of cap bits\\ndirect3d 101 introduces feature levels 100 and 101 which allow use of only the hardware features defined in the specified version of direct3d api direct3d 11 adds level 110 and 10 level 9  a subset of the direct3d 10 api designed to run on direct3d 9 hardware which has three feature levels 91 92 and 93 grouped by common capabilities of low med and highend video cards the runtime directly uses direct3d 9 ddi provided in all wddm drivers feature level 111 has been introduced with direct3d 111\\nnet framework\\nin 2002 microsoft released a version of directx compatible with the microsoft net framework thus allowing programmers to take advantage of directx functionality from within net applications using compatible languages such as managed c or the use of the c programming language this api was known as managed directx or mdx for short and claimed to operate at 98 of performance of the underlying native directx apis in december 2005 february 2006 april 2006 and august 2006 microsoft released successive updates to this library culminating in a beta version called managed directx 20 while managed directx 20 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers development on this version has subsequently been discontinued and it is no longer supported the managed directx 20 library expired on october 5 2006\\nduring the gdc 2006 microsoft presented the xna framework a new managed version of directx similar but not identical to managed directx that is intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate directx hlsl and other tools in one package it also supports the execution of managed code on the xbox 360 the xna game studio express rtm was made available on december 11 2006 as a free download for windows xp unlike the directx runtime managed directx xna framework or the xbox 360 apis xinput xact etc have not shipped as part of windows developers are expected to redistribute the runtime components along with their games or applications\\nno microsoft product including the latest xna releases provides directx 10 support for the net framework\\nthe other approach for directx in managed languages is to use thirdparty libraries like\\nalternatives\\nthere are alternatives to the directx family of apis with opengl its successor vulkan metal and mantle having the most features comparable to direct3d examples of other apis include sdl allegro openmax openml openal opencl fmod sfml etc many of these libraries are crossplatform or have open codebases there are also alternative implementations that aim to provide the same api such as the one in wine furthermore the developers of reactos are trying to reimplement directx under the name reactx'}, {'title': 'Camille_Pissarro', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'camille pissarro    10 july 1830\\xa0 13 november 1903 was a danishfrench impressionist and neoimpressionist painter born on the island of st thomas now in the us virgin islands but then in the danish west indies his importance resides in his contributions to both impressionism and postimpressionism pissarro studied from great forerunners including gustave courbet and jeanbaptistecamille corot he later studied and worked alongside georges seurat and paul signac when he took on the neoimpressionist style at the age of 54\\nin 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists becoming the pivotal figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members art historian john rewald called pissarro the dean of the impressionist painters not only because he was the oldest of the group but also by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced kind and warmhearted personality paul czanne said he was a father for me a man to consult and a little like the good lord and he was also one of paul gauguins masters pierreauguste renoir referred to his work as revolutionary through his artistic portrayals of the common man as pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without artifice or grandeur\\npissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight paris impressionist exhibitions from 1874 to 1886 he acted as a father figure not only to the impressionists but to all four of the major postimpressionists czanne seurat gauguin and van gogh\\nearly years\\njacob abraham camille pissarro was born on 10 july 1830 on the island of st thomas to frederick abraham gabriel pissarro and rachel manzanopomi his father was of portuguese jewish descent and held french nationality his mother was from a frenchjewish family from the island of st thomas his father was a merchant who came to the island from france to deal with the hardware store of a deceased uncle isaac petit and married his widow the marriage caused a stir within st thomass small jewish community because she was previously married to fredericks uncle and according to jewish law a man is forbidden from marrying his aunt in subsequent years his four children attended the allblack primary school upon his death his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and st thomas protestant church\\nwhen camille was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in france he studied at the savary academy in passy near paris while a young student he developed an early appreciation of the french art masters monsieur savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to st thomas which he did when he was seventeen however his father preferred he work in his business as a port clerk he took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practice drawing during breaks and after work\\nwhen pissarro turned twentyone danish artist fritz melbye then living on st thomas inspired him to take on painting as a fulltime profession becoming his teacher and friend pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in venezuela where he and melbye spent the next two years working as artists in caracas and la guaira he drew everything he could including landscapes village scenes and numerous sketches enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks in 1855 he moved back to paris where he began working as assistant to anton melbye fritz melbyes brother\\nlife in france\\nin paris he worked as assistant to danish painter anton melbye he also studied paintings by other artists whose style impressed him courbet charlesfranois daubigny jeanfranois millet and corot he also enrolled in various classes taught by masters at schools such as cole des beauxarts and acadmie suisse but pissarro eventually found their teaching methods stifling states art historian john rewald this prompted him to search for alternative instruction which he requested and received from corot\\nparis salon and corots influence\\nhis initial paintings were in accord with the standards at the time to be displayed at the paris salon the official body whose academic traditions dictated the kind of art that was acceptable the salons annual exhibition was essentially the only marketplace for young artists to gain exposure as a result pissarro worked in the traditional and prescribed manner to satisfy the tastes of its official committee\\nin 1859 his first painting was accepted and exhibited his other paintings during that period were influenced by camille corot who tutored him he and corot both shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature it was by corot that pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors also called plein air painting pissarro found corot along with the work of gustave courbet to be statements of pictorial truth writes rewald he discussed their work often jeanfranois millet was another whose work he admired especially his sentimental renditions of rural life\\nuse of natural outdoor settings\\nduring this period pissarro began to understand and appreciate the importance of expressing on canvas the beauties of nature without adulteration after a year in paris he therefore began to leave the city and paint scenes in the countryside to capture the daily reality of village life he found the french countryside to be picturesque and worthy of being painted it was still mostly agricultural and sometimes called the golden age of the peasantry pissarro later explained the technique of painting outdoors to a student\\nwork at the same time upon sky water branches ground keeping everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it paint generously and unhesitatingly for it is best not to lose the first impression\\ncorot would complete his paintings back in his studio often revising them according to his preconceptions pissarro however preferred to finish his paintings outdoors often at one sitting which gave his work a more realistic feel as a result his art was sometimes criticised as being vulgar because he painted what he saw rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes mounds of earth and trees in various stages of development according to one source such details were equivalent to todays art showing garbage cans or beer bottles on the side of a street this difference in style created disagreements between pissarro and corot\\nwith monet czanne and guillaumin\\nin 1859 while attending the free school the acadmie suisse pissarro became friends with a number of younger artists who likewise chose to paint in the more realistic style among them were claude monet armand guillaumin and paul czanne what they shared in common was their dissatisfaction with the dictates of the salon czannes work had been mocked at the time by the others in the school and writes rewald in his later years czanne never forgot the sympathy and understanding with which pissarro encouraged him as a part of the group pissarro was comforted from knowing he was not alone and that others similarly struggled with their art\\npissarro agreed with the group about the importance of portraying individuals in natural settings and expressed his dislike of any artifice or grandeur in his works despite what the salon demanded for its exhibits in 1863 almost all of the groups paintings were rejected by the salon and french emperor napoleon iii instead decided to place their paintings in a separate exhibit hall the salon des refuss however only works of pissarro and czanne were included and the separate exhibit brought a hostile response from both the officials of the salon and the public\\nin subsequent salon exhibits of 1865 and 1866 pissarro acknowledged his influences from melbye and corot whom he listed as his masters in the catalogue but in the exhibition of 1868 he no longer credited other artists as an influence in effect declaring his independence as a painter this was noted at the time by art critic and author mile zola who offered his opinion\\ncamille pissarro is one of the three or four true painters of this day\\xa0 i have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure\\nanother writer tries to describe elements of pissarros style\\nthe brightness of his palette envelops objects in atmosphere\\xa0 he paints the smell of the earth\\nand though on orders from the hanging committee and the marquis de chennevires pissarros paintings of pontoise for example had been skyed hung near the ceiling this did not prevent julesantoine castagnary from noting that the qualities of his paintings had been observed by art lovers at the age of thirtyeight pissarro had begun to win himself a reputation as a landscapist to rival corot and daubigny\\nin the late 1860s or early 1870s pissarro became fascinated with japanese prints which influenced his desire to experiment in new compositions he described the art to his son lucien\\nit is marvelous this is what i see in the art of this astonishing people\\xa0 nothing that leaps to the eye a calm a grandeur an extraordinary unity a rather subdued radiance\\xa0\\nmarriage and children\\nin 1871 in croydon england he married his mothers maid julie vellay a vineyard growers daughter with whom he had seven children six of which would become painters lucien pissarro 18631944 georges henri manzana pissarro 18711961 flix pissarro 18741897 18781952 18811948 and paulmile pissarro 18841972 they lived outside paris in pontoise and later in louveciennes both of which places inspired many of his paintings including scenes of village life along with rivers woods and people at work he also kept in touch with the other artists of his earlier group especially monet renoir czanne and frdric bazille\\nthe london years\\nafter the outbreak of the francoprussian war of 187071 having only danish nationality and being unable to join the army he moved his family to norwood then a village on the edge of london however his style of painting which was a forerunner of what was later called impressionism did not do well he wrote to his friend thodore duret that my painting doesnt catch on not at all\\xa0\\npissarro met the paris art dealer paul durandruel in london who became the dealer who helped sell his art for most of his life durandruel put him in touch with monet who was likewise in london during this period they both viewed the work of british landscape artists john constable and j m w turner which confirmed their belief that their style of open air painting gave the truest depiction of light and atmosphere an effect that they felt could not be achieved in the studio alone pissarros paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of impasto giving more depth to the work\\npaintings\\nthrough the paintings pissarro completed at this time he records sydenham and the norwoods at a time when they were just recently connected by railways but prior to the expansion of suburbia one of the largest of these paintings is a view of st bartholomews church at lawrie park avenue commonly known as  in the collection of the national gallery in london twelve oil paintings date from his stay in upper norwood and are listed and illustrated in the catalogue raisonn prepared jointly by his fifth child ludovicrodolphe pissarro and lionello venturi and published in 1939 these paintings include norwood under the snow and lordship lane station views of the crystal palace relocated from hyde park dulwich college sydenham hill all saints church upper norwood and a lost painting of st stephens church\\nreturning to france pissarro lived in pontoise from 1872 to 1884 in 1890 he again visited england and painted some ten scenes of central london he came back again in 1892 painting in kew gardens and kew green and also in 1897 when he produced several oils described as being of bedford park chiswick but in fact all being of the nearby stamford brook area except for one of bath road which runs from stamford brook along the south edge of bedford park\\nfrench impressionism\\nwhen pissarro returned to his home in france after the war he discovered that of the 1500 paintings he had done over 20 years which he was forced to leave behind when he moved to london only 40 remained the rest had been damaged or destroyed by the soldiers who often used them as floor mats outside in the mud to keep their boots clean it is assumed that many of those lost were done in the impressionist style he was then developing thereby documenting the birth of impressionism armand silvestre a critic went so far as to call pissarro basically the inventor of this impressionist painting however pissarros role in the impressionist movement was less that of the great man of ideas than that of the good counselor and appeaser\\xa0 monet\\xa0 could be seen as the guiding force\\nhe soon reestablished his friendships with the other impressionist artists of his earlier group including czanne monet manet renoir and degas pissarro now expressed his opinion to the group that he wanted an alternative to the salon so their group could display their own unique styles\\nto assist in that endeavour in 1873 he helped establish a separate collective called the socit anonyme des artistes peintres sculpteurs et graveurs which included fifteen artists pissarro created the groups first charter and became the pivotal figure in establishing and holding the group together one writer noted that with his prematurely grey beard the fortythreeyearold pissarro was regarded as a wise elder and father figure by the group yet he was able to work alongside the other artists on equal terms due to his youthful temperament and creativity another writer said of him that he has unchanging spiritual youth and the look of an ancestor who remained a young man\\nimpressionist exhibitions that shocked the critics\\nthe following year in 1874 the group held their first impressionist exhibition which shocked and horrified the critics who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious historical or mythological settings they found fault with the impressionist paintings on many grounds\\na revolutionary style\\npissarro showed five of his paintings all landscapes at the exhibit and again mile zola praised his art and that of the others in the impressionist exhibit of 1876 however art critic albert wolff complained in his review try to make m pissarro understand that trees are not violet that sky is not the color of fresh butter\\xa0 journalist and art critic octave mirbeau on the other hand writes camille pissarro has been a revolutionary through the revitalized working methods with which he has endowed painting\\naccording to rewald pissarro had taken on an attitude more simple and natural than the other artists he writes\\nrather than glorifyingconsciously or notthe rugged existence of the peasants he placed them without any pose in their habitual surroundings thus becoming an objective chronicler of one of the many facets of contemporary life\\nin later years czanne also recalled this period and referred to pissarro as the first impressionist in 1906 a few years after pissarros death czanne then 67 and a role model for the new generation of artists paid pissarro a debt of gratitude by having himself listed in an exhibition catalogue as paul czanne pupil of pissarro\\npissarro degas and american impressionist mary cassatt planned a journal of their original prints in the late 1870s a project that nevertheless came to nothing when degas withdrew art historian and the artists greatgrandson joachim pissarro notes that they professed a passionate disdain for the salons and refused to exhibit at them together they shared an almost militant resolution against the salon and through their later correspondences it is clear that their mutual admiration was based on a kinship of ethical as well as aesthetic concerns\\ncassatt had befriended degas and pissarro years earlier when she joined pissarros newly formed french impressionist group and gave up opportunities to exhibit in the united states she and pissarro were often treated as two outsiders by the salon since neither were french or had become french citizens however she was fired up with the cause of promoting impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting out of solidarity with her new friends towards the end of the 1890s she began to distance herself from the impressionists avoiding degas at times as she did not have the strength to defend herself against his wicked tongue instead she came to prefer the company of the gentle camille pissarro with whom she could speak frankly about the changing attitudes toward art she once described him as a teacher that could have taught the stones to draw correctly\\nneoimpressionist period\\nby the 1880s pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting to break out of what he felt was an artistic mire as a result pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people which he had done in venezuela in his youth degas described pissarros subjects as peasants working to make a living\\nhowever this period also marked the end of the impressionist period due to pissarros leaving the movement as joachim pissarro points out\\nonce such a diehard impressionist as pissarro had turned his back on impressionism it was apparent that impressionism had no chance of surviving\\xa0\\nit was pissarros intention during this period to help educate the public by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings without idealising their lives pierreauguste renoir in 1882 referred to pissarros work during this period as revolutionary in his attempt to portray the common man pissarro himself did not use his art to overtly preach any kind of political message however although his preference for painting humble subjects was intended to be seen and purchased by his upper class clientele he also began painting with a more unified brushwork along with pure strokes of color\\nstudying with seurat and signac\\nin 1885 he met georges seurat and paul signac both of whom relied on a more scientific theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colours to create the illusion of blended colours and shading when viewed from a distance pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more timeconsuming and laborious technique referred to as pointillism the paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his impressionist works and were on display in the 1886 impressionist exhibition but under a separate section along with works by seurat signac and his son lucien\\nall four works were considered an exception to the eighth exhibition joachim pissarro notes that virtually every reviewer who commented on pissarros work noted his extraordinary capacity to change his art revise his position and take on new challenges one critic writes\\nit is difficult to speak of camille pissarro\\xa0 what we have here is a fighter from way back a master who continually grows and courageously adapts to new theories\\npissarro explained the new art form as a phase in the logical march of impressionism but he was alone among the other impressionists with this attitude however joachim pissarro states that pissarro thereby became the only artist who went from impressionism to neoimpressionism\\nin 1884 art dealer theo van gogh asked pissarro if he would take in his older brother vincent as a boarder in his home lucien pissarro wrote that his father was impressed by van goghs work and had foreseen the power of this artist who was 23 years younger although van gogh never boarded with him pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color ideas which he later used in his paintings notes lucien\\nabandoning neoimpressionism\\npissarro eventually turned away from neoimpressionism claiming its system was too artificial he explains in a letter to a friend\\nhaving tried this theory for four years and having then abandoned it\\xa0 i can no longer consider myself one of the neoimpressionists\\xa0 it was impossible to be true to my sensations and consequently to render life and movement impossible to be faithful to the effects so random and so admirable of nature impossible to give an individual character to my drawing that i had to give up\\nhowever after reverting to his earlier style his work became according to rewald more subtle his color scheme more refined his drawing firmer\\xa0 so it was that pissarro approached old age with an increased mastery\\nbut the change also added to pissarros continual financial hardship which he felt until his 60s his headstrong courage and a tenacity to undertake and sustain the career of an artist writes joachim pissarro was due to his lack of fear of the immediate repercussions of his stylistic decisions in addition his work was strong enough to bolster his morale and keep him going he writes his impressionist contemporaries however continued to view his independence as a mark of integrity and they turned to him for advice referring to him as pre pissarro father pissarro\\nlater years\\nin his older age pissarro suffered from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather as a result of this disability he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms he often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view he moved around northern france and painted from hotels in rouen paris le havre and dieppe on his visits to london he would do the same\\npissarro died in paris on 13 november 1903 and was buried in pre lachaise cemetery\\nlegacy and influence\\nduring the period pissarro exhibited his works art critic armand silvestre had called pissarro the most real and most naive member of the impressionist group his work has also been described by art historian diane kelder as expressing the same quiet dignity sincerity and durability that distinguished his person she adds that no member of the group did more to mediate the internecine disputes that threatened at times to break it apart and no one was a more diligent proselytizer of the new painting\\naccording to pissarros son lucien his father painted regularly with czanne beginning in 1872 he recalls that czanne walked a few miles to join pissarro at various settings in pontoise while they shared ideas during their work the younger czanne wanted to study the countryside through pissarros eyes as he admired pissarros landscapes from the 1860s czanne although only nine years younger than pissarro said that he was a father for me a man to consult and a little like the good lord\\nlucien pissarro was taught painting by his father and described him as a splendid teacher never imposing his personality on his pupil gauguin who also studied under him referred to pissarro as a force with which future artists would have to reckon art historian diane kelder notes that it was pissarro who introduced gauguin who was then a young stockbroker studying to become an artist to degas and czanne gauguin near the end of his career wrote a letter to a friend in 1902 shortly before pissarros death\\nif we observe the totality of pissarros work we find there despite fluctuations not only an extreme artistic will never belied but also an essentially intuitive purebred art\\xa0 he was one of my masters and i do not deny him\\nthe american impressionist mary cassatt who at one point lived in paris to study art and joined his impressionist group noted that he was such a teacher that he could have taught the stones to draw correctly\\ncaribbean author and scholar derek walcott based his booklength poem tiepolos hound 2000 on pissarros life\\nthe legacy of nazilooted pissarros\\nduring the early 1930s throughout europe jewish owners of numerous fine art masterpieces found themselves forced to give up or sell off their collections for minimal prices due to antijewish laws created by the new nazi regime many jews were forced to flee germany starting in 1933 and then as the nazis expanded their hold over all of europe austria france holland poland italy and other countries the nazis created special looting organizations like the reichsleiter rosenberg taskforce whose mission it was to seize jewish property notably valuable artworks when those forced into exile or deported to extermination camps owned valuables including artwork they were often sold to finance the nazi war effort sent to hitlers personal museum traded or seized by officials for personal gain several artworks by pissarro were looted from their jewish owners in germany france and elsewhere by the nazis\\npissarros shepherdess bringing home the sheep la bergre rentrant des moutons was looted from the jewish art collectors yvonne et raoul meyer in france in 1941 and transited via switzerland and new york before entering the fred jones jr museum at the university of oklahoma in 2014 meyers daughter lonienolle meyer filed a restitution claim which resulted in years of court battle the lawsuit resulted in the recognition of meyers ownership and its transfer to france for five years coupled with an agreement to shuttle the painting back and forth between paris and oklahoma every three years after that however in 2020 meyer filed suit in a french court to challenge the accord after fred jones jr museum sued meyer requesting heavy financial penalties the holocaust survivor abandoned her effort to recover the pissarro saying i have no other choice\\npissarros picking peas la cueillette was looted from jewish

was seized and sold in a forced auction before silberberg and his wife johanna were murdered in auschwitz\\nin the decades after world war ii many art masterpieces were found on display in various galleries and museums in europe and the united states often with false provenances and labels missing some as a result of legal action were later returned to the families of the original owners many of the recovered paintings were then donated to the same or other museums as a gift\\none such lost piece pissarros 1897 oil painting rue st honor apres midi effet de pluie was discovered hanging at

for the best short feature at the 2012 silver crane film awards\\ndeimantas narkeviius lives and works in vilnius lithuania\\nbiography\\nchildhood in utena\\ndeimantas narkeviius was born in utena lithuania in 1964 at the time when lithuania was part of the soviet union\\nin several interviews such as in the one from 2003 with curator hans ulrich obrist narkeviius reflected on the importance of films he saw in his early childhood his first experience of cinema was watching movies with his parents in the theatre or at home on television films by prominent soviet directors such as sergei eisenstein in particular his ivan grozny part ii 1958 which he saw at the age of five and bronenosec potiomkin 1925 were among his earliest cinematic experiences that in narkeviiuss own words had a dramatic impact on him\\nlater in his early adolescence narkeviius familiarised with the cinema of his time even further by seeing sergei parajanovs hakob hovnatanyan 1967 which again had a significant impact on the young artist it was then that he became fascinated with the films produced in the studios of the soviet republics which revealed local identities traditions and languages in another interview from 2011 narkeviius described technological and stylistic aspects of parajanovs film that moved him as a young person\\ngrowing up narkeviius was often ill which meant he had to stay at home as a result he spent a considerable amount of time watching soviet television the documentary material on the 16mm film that used to be on tv in the 1970s made an impression on narkeviius who later used the same type of film extensively in his artistic practice interviews were filmed with 16mm cameras and then they were processed and made ready for the evening news on the same day since they were done in quite a rush it provoked considerable experimentation these films were screened and then broadcast raising a range of possibilities for using film narkeviius who grew familiar with these images admitted to the ingenuity of their production and the effect it had on him even after many years i sometimes look back at them and i see how creative they were  how creative the camerawork and the editing was\\nthe early influences of cinema and television describe narkeviiuss artistic style and means of production they can potentially be seen as a factor that affected his decision of selecting filmmaking as opposed to object making early in his career the history and context of the soviet union in which these early experiences were produced had become the principal subject of narkeviiuss oeuvre\\nstudent years in vilnius and london\\nat the age of fourteen narkeviius was sent to vilnius by his parents to study in the art boarding school where he matured surrounded by students who came from similar backgrounds according to the artist during this period still in the soviet union everything was quite impersonal and at the beginning of his artistic career he was trying to personalise what he was doing to motivate himself artists at that time were seen as advertisers of the regime  which compared with postwar stalinism was relatively liberal however the primary purpose of artists still was to provide an ideological service he or she always had to be prepared for it\\nafter finishing secondary school at the age eighteen for a year and a half narkeviius worked in a museum that exhibited a collection of soviet art in an interview with melissa gronlund he admitted that he was amazed at how funny those artworks were to him later in 1987 narkeviius enrolled in vilnius art institute now vilnius academy of arts where he chose to study sculpture the academys curriculum was rigid and didnt excite him as much as he would have expected in his own words prominent lithuanian expatriate artists jonas mekas and george mainas meant more to him than any teacher he had at that time\\nbetween 1992 and 1993 while still a member of the vilnius academy of arts narkeviius lived in london uk in england he was exploring possibilities of object making and approaching the medium from a conceptual standpoint london was an exciting place to be for the emerging artist this period which was marked by intensive learning had a significant impact for narkeviiuss understanding of contemporary art as he got exposed to londons art milieu for example artists of the yba generation but more so for his motivation for becoming an artist a dense concentration of artists and a competitive artistic climate meant that the standards for art were set high but it also led to a strong community sense artists were often collaborating and helping each other in different ways narkeviius who was one of them was able to benefit from these processes\\nafter his return from london narkeviius was interested in sitespecific objects and continued producing sculptural works however after a short while he realised that he was leaning towards the storytelling and felt that he needed to find a better media for that as a result he began recording interviews with people from his environment for the emerging artist it proved to be a perfect medium for developing narratives as well as for exploring sound and visual language\\nfilm career\\nsince the late 90s narkeviius worked mostly in film and video experimenting with the film structure and thematising the weight of individual memories and personal revisions of history the majority of his films deal extensively with the cultural legacy of communism and attempts to erase it after the fall of the warsaw pact regimes in 1989 and the collapse of the soviet union two years later with an emphasis on statues sculptors artists and moving images these themes first emerged in his early films europa 54 54  25 19 1997 legend coming true 1999 and energy lithuania 2000 a 7minute 35mm film hisstory 1998 shown at manifesta ii in 1998 gained the artist international recognition making narkeviius into one of the leading contemporary filmmakers of the eastern european region\\nin 2001 narkeviius represented lithuania at the 49th venice biennale two years later he came back to venice to show his work in the utopia station curated by molly nesbit and hans ulrich obrist describing his works relationship with his nations past in an interview with obrist narkeviius said that memory is a funny thing i think our brain has a filter you remember what you want to remember and you recreate the stories of the memory in a way that you want to remember them and how you would like to create them\\nin perhaps his bestknown film the role of a lifetime 2003 commissioned by ukbased organisation art and sacred places for a parish church in brighton narkeviius asked what it meant to be a filmmaker with a social conscience the centrepiece of the film is an interview with british director peter watkins whose politicallycharged fictionalised documentarystyle works had addressed the hungarian uprising the battle of culloden 1964 and the la commune paris 1871 2000 and who had left the uk in frustration at censorship and neglect settling in vilnius the interview is juxtaposed with 1960s super8 footage of brighton amp hove and sketches by lithuanian artist mindaugas lukoaitis of grtas park the sculpture garden 80 miles south of vilnius where many of the countrys soviet monuments ended up after the fall of the soviet union noting that some people considered the decision to save the statues a disaster watkins described the park as a place to contemplate mans unbelievable folly and inhumanity  and sadly the endless repetition of history\\nnarkeviiuss next film once in the xx century 2004 played with the lithuanian television footage that was broadcast across the world of the statue of lenin being torn down in vilniuss lukiks square in 1991 recutting it in reverse narkeviius showed a jubilant crowd cheering the monument as it was hoisted from the back of a vehicle onto a plinth being reunited with its legs in once in the xx century he continued to explore and contextualise the problematics of public monument and monumentality  a central theme in narkeviiuss artistic practice\\nthe head 2007 consisted entirely of photographs and archival footage made for east german television the film documents the creation of the worlds secondlargest head sculpture  a sevenmetrehigh profile of karl marx by soviet socialistrealist lev kerbel 19172003  from its conception in 1968 to its unveiling in karlmarx stadt now chemnitz in 1971 narkeviius commented on his film by saying objects from that period are not a crime they are rather testimonies to historical crimes visual heritage of an era to be kept and appreciated if we want to feel any compassion for what the people who lived then lost and in order to separate individuals from their creatively inhibited artworks  even if the consequences of this aesthetical repression can still be felt in the eastern bloc \\nfor revisiting solaris 2007 narkeviius adapted the final chapter of stanisaw lems novel solaris 1961 which andrei tarkovsky left out in his 1972 film in narkeviiuss film lithuanian actor donatas banionis reprised his role as chris kelvin after more than 30 years in revisiting solaris narkeviius used a series of photographs taken by prominent lithuanian symbolist painter mikalojus konstantinas iurlionis in anapa now russia in 1905 to represent the foreign planet as well as eduard artemyevs iconic score from the original film revisiting solaris marked an outstanding interdisciplinary effort by the lithuanian filmmaker to join multiple talents from different periods making it into a timeless monument\\nrestricted sensation 2011 was narkeviius first long feature that was shown in cinemas a 45minute length film depicts the abuse of a talented young gay theatre director in the lithuanian ssr in the 1970s with the poststalinist recriminalisation of homosexuality representing the oppressive cultural policy that took hold as stalin assumed total power in the late 1920s although it can be read as a comment both on that periods homophobia and vladimir putins current persecution of russias lgbtqi population narkeviius said he was not aiming to depict the explicit illegal life of gays in the soviet union rather the film comments on the distrust and intolerance of what is perceived as foreign to a particular countrys culture and was an attempt to identify the causes of the increasing prevalence of intolerance\\nhis most recent work 20 july2015 2016 traces the removal of several socialist realist sculptures from the green bridge in central vilnius lithuania which had been erected in 1952 presented in immersive 3d  narkeviiuss first use of the medium  it culminates in the final removal of the monuments at 2 am on 20 july 2015\\nartistic work\\nthe role of a lifetime\\ndeimantas narkeviius\\nlithuania 2003\\n17 minutes colourbampw stereo 43\\noriginal format 8mm super 8mm and 35mm film\\nit is perhaps the role of a lifetime 2003 that most evocatively and thoughtfully ties together narkeviiuss interests in the uncertainties at the heart of postsoviet lithuania with the implications of his own work in creating film and video the film combines three distinct elements the first one is an interview with the british filmmaker peter watkins that narkeviius recorded in lithuania known for his pioneering docudrama films culloden 1964 and the war game 1965 which politicised and fictionalised the documentary form watkins lived in vilnius for many years in the course of his selfimposed exile from britain the second is a sequence of drawings of the lithuanian landscape by lithuanian artist mindaugas lukoaitis a number of these drawing show grto park a kind of soviet theme park in the south of lithuania that acts as a repository of social realist sculptures from the postwar era the third is a footage of brighton life shot by an amateur film enthusiast geoffrey cook which narkeviius found in archives in brighton\\nin works like punishment park 1970 or la commune paris 1871 2000 watkins has challenged what he calls the monoform cinematographic editing that reduces disparate visual and acoustic parts to a narrative whole narkeviius undoes the monoform by putting together images and sounds that do not match each other in what appears to be a biographical documentary the film scenes are too idyllic and too recent for the traumatic world war ii childhood that watkins recollects a summer hum of birds and insects accompanies his description of the soviet monuments collected in grto and the pencil sketches of the park show a thick layer of snow covering the defunct socialist heroes maybe the wizened man in the stills is not watkins but the protagonist of yet another history\\nmore dialogical than monological the role of a lifetime ends up highlighting distinct bodies of work and visions narkeviiuss audio interviews with watkins drawings by mindaugas lukoaitis filmed by audrius kemeys who catches lukoaitiss hand and archival footage of brighton filmed by geoffrey cook in the 1960s in his role as a master editor narkeviius mismatches these silent images and invisible sounds not only to question documentarys veracity but also to begin that elusive discussion with the audience who must put parts together experiencing the gap between watkins eloquent remarks on creativity and cooks quirky views of brighton comes close to participant observation cooks brighton initially appears to be part of watkins childhood memories only to emerge as the eye of yet another filmmaker in this shift the cathartic hit of nostalgia instantly delivered by super 8 dissolves into two visions of the past whose incommensurability makes them all the more fascinating\\nas in other works in the role of a lifetime it is narkeviiuss editing of the quotidian and the unmonumental qualities of everyday life that complicate the material and bring it into dialogue with the misplaced authoritarianism of the dead monuments watkinss attention to reinterpreting history and continually bringing it into dialogue with the presentday  resistance to pushing the past away out of sight and mind  is mirrored in the dystopicutopic space of the sculpture park neither alive nor dead but fully both as rendered by narkeviius the space represents the indigestible qualities of these objects burdened by their role as icons of a past regime both watkins and narkeviius share a profound scepticism about images that promise to be authentic representations of history independently of each other they have produced films with similar concerns dismantling the conventional visual rhetoric of historic testimony and searching for a cinematic language that does not subject the history to the forces of ideological assimilation or mass media commodification\\nonce in the xx century\\ndeimantas narkeviius\\nlithuania 2004\\n7 minutes 56 seconds colour stereo 43\\noriginal format betacam sp video\\nonce in the xx century 2004 is based on video documentation of the removal of a monumental public sculpture of lenin from lukiki square in lithuania in 1991 the artist acquired footage from the lithuanian national tv archive and a freelance video reporter to have a twocamera perspective on the event these images of the figure hanging above the crowd with his hand raised have been broadcast hundreds of times by cnn and other news channels over the last decades as a symbol of the disintegration of the soviet union and the failure of communism\\nin deimantas narkeviiuss video lenins ghost statue is reinstalled recutting the action in reverse narkeviius shows a violently enthusiastic crowd cheering a statue as it is paraded on the back of a vehicle and raised into the air to then swing uncannily into place as lenin is seamlessly reunited with his legs the demise of eastern european socialist regimes at the end of the twentieth century led to the removal of many such monuments taken down by either the state or the people themselves in hope for a better future for many this hope has not been fulfilled narkeviiuss historical reversal ironically points to the repetition of scenes in history and talks about the longing for or denial of political and economic systems\\nonce in the xx century throws into relief the absurdity of the scene as a potential event  the public barely ever gets as wild about installing authority as it does about dismantling it however the video also reveals a moment of breakage in the countrys history mirrored in the ruinimage of a pair of calves and feet stranded on a plinth with no body or head moments of dramatic political violently break the future open to reveal an unnervingly undefined limbo however a violent break with the past such as this  when it is open season on the symbols of the powers just ousted  is also a moment of groundless suspension\\nin 2005 flash art used an image of the figure of lenin from narkeviius film to promote the 2nd prague biennale 2005 the description mistakenly said it was the statue of lenin being removed from kaluzhskaya square former october square in moscow russia in reality lenin statue is still in kaluzhskaya square\\nrevisiting solaris\\ndeimantas narkeviius\\nlithuania 2007\\n18 minutes colourbampw stereo 169\\noriginal format 35mm film\\nnarkeviius first saw andrej tarkovskys film in the 1970s in an interview with larissa harris he admitted that then when he was about sixteen or seventeen he did not get it at all simply not understanding what was going on in the film nevertheless it engaged him and raised his curiosity later on narkeviius watched solaris over and over again i kept watching it until having reached my thirties i finally liked it a lot perhaps that was also due to the fact that i started to lose people who were close to me\\nout of tarkovskys film language lems book photographs by mikalojus konstantinas iurlionis and donatas banionis narkeviius made another solaris in the same conversation narkeviius stressed the fact that within his film he meets chris kelvin and not donatas banionis revisiting solaris is in a way an extension of the tarkovskys film many years later donatas banionis who initially was not so keen on reprising his role did not have any reflection on his role in narkeviiuss film and did not make any comments on the old film either according to the artist he simply is chris kelvin again\\nin solaris before donatas banionis as chris kelvin leaves earth the old pilot burton attacks him as not fit to go into space and an accountant not a scientist in revisiting solaris banioniskelvin and an unnamed woman who is played by narkeviiuss wife say these words to the artist who in such a way himself becomes young chris kelvin the difference between tarkovskys and narkeviiuss versions of the scene is that takeoff does not happen the image of the planet solaris is represented as banioniskelvins memories the mysterious planet is revisited by evoking both the memories of a man who was there some time ago and also viewers collective memories of the tarkovskys film there happened in the form of a fiction film in 1972 but narkeviius accepts it as reality\\nas with his other work narkeviius is awaking something anachronistic something that has gone from our everyday or contemporary media experience by bringing a real man a witness to an outstanding cinematographic achievement like solaris by a tarkovsky he emphasises that some dimensions of the film remain relevant the presence of d banionis is also a link between then and now between created reality and its impact on a viewer many years later the man is among us the way he moves is the same his look is the same so 1972 is still present\\nmost of the selected locations seen in revisiting solaris are functional architecture from the period of radical modernisation they are linked with the recent past which for narkeviius was very much about creating a future in comparison in solaris the future is represented by the beautiful shots of the roads and highways tarkovsky took in tokyo in 1970 narkeviius chose the locations for banionis to discover them when talking to l harris he said that he wanted him to establish contact with those spaces accommodate them with his presence while being filmed the room with two telephones for example is a former kgb prison now the museum of genocide victims in vilnius where decades ago people were killed for political reasons for that scene narkeviius chose an excerpt from lems book that talks about the nature of human thoughts what potential dangers can result from materialisation of some thoughts what phantoms were generated by human minds in recent history narkeviius rhetorically asks the viewers of his film\\nobjects\\nalthough deimantas narkeviius is primarily known for his cinematographic work he started his career working with sculpture and found objects narkeviiuss aim to personalise the relationship between the artist and his work emerged during his study years in vilnius academy of arts as also did his search for a means of expression matching the conceptual idea it prompted him to embrace the avantgarde tradition and the principles of sitespecific art at that stage he sought to cast off the dominant romantic concept of art and actualise other principles of visual expression that would directly and didactically reflect the thinking of the artist his oneyear stay in london was crucial in this regard because it was there that he introduced readymade into his artistic practice\\nnarkeviiuss sculptures actively question preconceptions regarding daytoday objects assigning them new and indeterminate functions he builds his creative platform by siting them in the historical context of the environment they belong to in such a way narkeviius creates a new semantic field to communicate his ideas via the physical form\\nthe work too long on a pedestal was made in 1994 when the lithuanian public was still affected by the huge political and social shifts of the early 1990s the stagnant and morally compromised ideological system that had dominated social life for nearly 50 years was being replaced by a new one this work tinged with subtle humour is a reflection on how the heritage of the political system becomes history the means of expression selected by the artist a pair of wornout classicstyle shoes now filled with coarse salt points to the statues of heroes that used to embody the value system of the former epoch but the people promptly removed them from their pedestals as politics changed its course\\nfilmography\\neuropa 54 54  25 19 1997\\nhisstory 1998\\nmass for the truth

19thcentury german romantic landscape painter generally considered the most important german artist of his generation he is best known for his midperiod allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies morning mists barren trees or gothic ruins his primary interest was the contemplation of nature and his often symbolic and anticlassical work seeks to convey a subjective emotional response to the natural world friedrichs paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes reducing the figures to a scale that according to the art historian christopher john murray directs the viewers gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\nfriedrich was born in the town of greifswald on the baltic sea in what was at the time swedish pomerania he studied in copenhagen until 1798 before settling in dresden he came of age during a period when across europe a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality this shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world as artists such as friedrich j m w turner and john constable sought to depict nature as a divine creation to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\nfriedrichs work brought him renown early in his career and contemporaries such as the french sculptor david dangers spoke of him as a man who had discovered the tragedy of landscape nevertheless his work fell from favour during his later years and he died in obscurity as germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century a new sense of urgency characterised its art and friedrichs contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age the early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirtytwo of his paintings in berlin by the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the expressionists and in the 1930s and early 1940s surrealists and existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work the rise of nazism in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in friedrichs popularity but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were by association with the nazi movement interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect it was not until the late 1970s that friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the german romantic movement and a painter of international importance\\nlife\\nearly years and family\\ncaspar david friedrich was born on 5 september 1774 in greifswald swedish pomerania on the baltic coast of germany the sixth of ten children he was raised in the strict lutheran creed of his father adolf gottlieb friedrich a candlemaker and soap boiler records of the familys financial circumstances are contradictory while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored others record that they were raised in relative poverty he became familiar with death from an early age his mother sophie died in 1781 when he was seven a year later his sister elisabeth died and a second sister maria succumbed to typhus in 1791 arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother johann christoffer died at the age of thirteen caspar david witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown some accounts suggest that johann christoffer perished while trying to rescue caspar david who was also in danger on the ice\\nfriedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist johann gottfried quistorp at the university of greifswald in his home city at which the art department is now named caspardavidfriedrichinstitut in his honour quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions as a result friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age through quistorp friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian ludwig gotthard kosegarten who taught that nature was a revelation of god quistorp introduced friedrich to the work of the german 17thcentury artist adam elsheimer whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape and nocturnal subjects during this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with swedish professor thomas thorild four years later friedrich entered the prestigious academy of copenhagen where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life living in copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the royal picture gallerys collection of 17thcentury dutch landscape painting at the academy he studied under teachers such as christian august lorentzen and the landscape painter jens juel these artists were inspired by the sturm und drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding romantic aesthetic and the waning neoclassical ideal mood was paramount and influence was drawn from such sources as the icelandic legend of edda the poems of ossian and norse mythology\\nmove to dresden\\nfriedrich settled permanently in dresden in 1798 during this early period he experimented in printmaking with etchings and designs for woodcuts which his furnituremaker brother cut by 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends despite these forays into other media he gravitated toward working primarily with ink watercolour and sepias with the exception of a few early pieces such as  1797 he did not work extensively with oils until his reputation was more established landscapes were his preferred subject inspired by frequent trips beginning in 1801 to the baltic coast bohemia the krkonoe and the harz mountains mostly based on the landscapes of northern germany his paintings depict woods hills harbors morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature these works were modeled on sketches and studies of scenic spots such as the cliffs on rgen the surroundings of dresden and the river elbe he executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil even providing topographical information yet the subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of friedrichs midperiod paintings were rendered from memory these effects took their strength from the depiction of light and of the illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water optical phenomena peculiar to the baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis\\nhis reputation as an artist was established when he won a prize in 1805 at the weimar competition organised by johann wolfgang von goethe at the time the weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and nowforgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neoclassical and pseudogreek styles the poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to goethes reputation so when friedrich entered two sepia drawingsprocession at dawn and fisherfolk by the seathe poet responded enthusiastically and wrote we must praise the artists resourcefulness in this picture fairly the drawing is well done the procession is ingenious and appropriate\\xa0 his treatment combines a great deal of firmness diligence and neatness\\xa0 the ingenious watercolour\\xa0 is also worthy of praise\\nfriedrich completed the first of his major paintings in 1808 at the age of 34 cross in the mountains today known as the tetschen altar is an altarpiece panel said to have been commissioned for a family chapel in tetschen bohemia the panel depicts a cross in profile at the top of a mountain alone and surrounded by pine trees controversially for the first time in christian art an altarpiece had showcased a landscape according to art historian linda siegel friedrichs design was the logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in natures world\\nalthough the altarpiece was generally coldly received it was friedrichs first painting to receive wide publicity the artists friends publicly defended the work while art critic basilius von ramdohr published a long article challenging friedrichs use of landscape in a religious context he rejected the idea that landscape painting could convey explicit meaning writing that it would be a veritable presumption if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions in 1809 comparing the rays of the evening sun to the light of the holy father this statement marked the only time friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work and the painting was among the few commissions the artist ever received\\nfollowing the purchase of two of his paintings by the prussian crown prince friedrich was elected a member of the berlin academy in 1810 yet in 1816 he sought to distance himself from prussian authority and applied that june for saxon citizenship the move was not expected the saxon government was profrench while friedrichs paintings were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly antifrench nevertheless with the aid of his dresdenbased friend graf vitzthum von eckstdt friedrich attained citizenship and in 1818 membership in the saxon academy with a yearly dividend of 150 thalers although he had hoped to receive a full professorship it was never awarded him as according to the german library of information it was felt that his painting was too personal his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students politics too may have played a role in stalling his career friedrichs decidedly germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the eras prevailing profrench attitudes\\nmarriage\\non 21 january 1818 friedrich married caroline bommer the twentyfiveyearold daughter of a dyer from dresden the couple had three children with their first emma arriving in 1820 physiologist and painter carl gustav carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either friedrichs life or personality yet his canvasses from this period including chalk cliffs on rgenpainted after his honeymoondisplay a new sense of levity while his palette is brighter and less austere human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period which siegel interprets as a reflection that the importance of human life particularly his family now occupies his thoughts more and more and his friends his wife and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art\\naround this time he found support from two sources in russia in 1820 the grand duke nikolai pavlovich at the behest of his wife alexandra feodorovna visited friedrichs studio and returned to saint petersburg with a number of his paintings an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years not long thereafter the poet vasily zhukovsky tutor to alexander ii met friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit for decades zhukovsky helped friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family his assistance toward the end of friedrichs career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist zhukovsky remarked that his friends paintings please us by their precision each of them awakening a memory in our mind\\nfriedrich was acquainted with philipp otto runge another leading german painter of the romantic period he was also a friend of georg friedrich kersting and painted him at work in his unadorned studio and of the norwegian painter johan christian clausen dahl 17881857 dahl was close to friedrich during the artists final years and he expressed dismay that to the artbuying public friedrichs pictures were only curiosities while the poet zhukovsky appreciated friedrichs psychological themes dahl praised the descriptive quality of friedrichs landscapes commenting that artists and connoisseurs saw in friedrichs art only a kind of mystic because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic\\xa0 they did not see friedrichs faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented\\nduring this period friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife he even created designs for some of the funerary art in dresdens cemeteries some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed munichs glass palace 1931 and later in the 1945 bombing of dresden\\nlater life and death\\nfriedrichs reputation steadily declined over the final fifteen years of his life as the ideals of early romanticism passed from fashion he came to be viewed as an eccentric and melancholy character out of touch with the times gradually his patrons fell away by 1820 he was living as a recluse and was described by friends as the most solitary of the solitary towards the end of his life he lived in relative poverty he became isolated and spent long periods of the day and night walking alone through woods and fields often beginning his strolls before sunrise\\nin june 1835 friedrich suffered his first stroke which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint as a result he was unable to work in oil instead he was limited to watercolour sepia and reworking older compositions\\nalthough his vision remained strong he had lost the full strength of his hand yet he was able to produce a final black painting seashore by moonlight 183536 described by vaughan as the darkest of all his shorelines in which richness of tonality compensates for the lack of his former finesse\\nsymbols of death appeared in his other work from this period soon after his stroke the russian royal family purchased a number of his earlier works and the proceeds allowed him to travel to teplitzin todays czech republicto recover\\nduring the mid1830s friedrich began a series of portraits and he returned to observing himself in nature as the art historian william vaughan has observed however he can see himself as a man greatly changed he is no longer the upright supportive figure that appeared in two men contemplating the moon in 1819 he is old and stiff\\xa0 he moves with a stoop\\nby 1838 he was capable only of working in a small format he and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends\\nfriedrich died in dresden on 7 may 1840 and was buried in dresdens trinitatisfriedhof trinity cemetery east of the city centre the entrance to which he had painted some 15 years earlier the simple flat gravestone lies northwest of the central roundel within the main avenue\\nby the time of his death his reputation and fame were waning and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community his artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime but not widely while the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art his work was too original and personal to be well understood by 1838 his work no longer sold or received attention from critics the romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found\\nafter his death carl gustav carus wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to friedrichs transformation of the conventions of landscape painting however carus articles placed friedrich firmly in his time and did not place the artist within a continuing tradition only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print and that was produced in very few copies\\nthemes\\nlandscape and the sublime\\nthe visualisation and portrayal of landscape in an entirely new manner was friedrichs key innovation he sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view as in the classic conception but rather to examine an instant of sublimity a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a selfcontained emotive subject friedrichs paintings commonly employed the rckenfigura person seen from behind contemplating the view the viewer is encouraged to place himself in the position of the rckenfigur by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feelingdie romantische stimmungslandschaft his art details a wide range of geographical features such as rock coasts forests and mountain scenes he often used the landscape to express religious themes during his time most of the bestknown paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism\\nfriedrich said the artist should paint not only what he sees before him but also what he sees within him if however he sees nothing within him then he should also refrain from painting that which he sees before him otherwise his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead expansive skies storms mist forests ruins and crosses bearing witness to the presence of god are frequent elements in friedrichs landscapes though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shorea charonlike motifand in the poplar tree it is referenced more directly in paintings like the abbey in the oakwood 180810 in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave toward a cross and through the portal of a church in ruins\\nhe was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is rendered as stark and dead friedrichs winter scenes are solemn and stillaccording to the art historian hermann beenken friedrich painted winter scenes in which no man has yet set his foot the theme of nearly all the older winter pictures had been less winter itself than life in winter in the 16th and 17th centuries it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters the wanderer it was friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life instead of many tones he sought the one and so in his landscape he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note\\nbare oak trees and tree stumps such as those in  c 1822 man and woman contemplating the moon c 1824 and willow bush under a setting sun c 1835 are recurring elements of friedrichs paintings symbolizing death countering the sense of despair are friedrichs symbols for redemption the cross and the clearing sky promise eternal life and the slender moon suggests hope and the growing closeness of christ in his paintings of the sea anchors often appear on the shore also indicating a spiritual hope german literature scholar alice kuzniar finds in friedrichs painting a temporalityan evocation of the passage of timethat is rarely highlighted in the visual arts for example in the abbey in the oakwood the movement of the monks away from the open grave and toward the cross and the horizon imparts friedrichs message that the final destination of mans life lies beyond the grave\\nwith dawn and dusk constituting prominent themes of his landscapes friedrichs own later years were characterized by a growing pessimism his work becomes darker revealing a fearsome monumentality the wreck of the hopealso known as the polar sea or the sea of ice 182324perhaps best summarizes friedrichs ideas and aims at this point though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received completed in 1824 it depicted a grim subject a shipwreck in the arctic ocean the image he produced with its grinding slabs of travertinecolored floe ice chewing up a wooden ship goes beyond documentary into allegory the frail bark of human aspiration crushed by the worlds immense and glacial indifference\\nfriedrichs written commentary on aesthetics was limited to a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830 in which he explained the need for the artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality his bestknown remark advises the artist to close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards he rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its totality as found in the work of contemporary painters like adrian ludwig richter 180384 and joseph anton koch 17681839\\nloneliness and death\\nboth friedrichs life and art have at times been perceived by some to have been marked with an overwhelming sense of loneliness art historians and some of his contemporaries attribute such interpretations to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood while friedrichs pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the taciturn man from the north\\nfriedrich suffered depressive episodes in 1799 18031805 c1813 in 1816 and between 1824 and 1826 there are noticeable thematic shifts in the works he produced during these episodes which see the emergence of such motifs and symbols as vultures owls graveyards and ruins from 1826 these motifs became a permanent feature of his output while his use of color became more dark and muted carus wrote in 1929 that friedrich is surrounded by a thick gloomy cloud of spiritual uncertainty though the noted art historian and curator hubertus gassner disagrees with such notions seeing in friedrichs work a positive and lifeaffirming subtext inspired by freemasonry and religion\\ngermanic folklore\\nreflecting friedrichs patriotism and resentment during the 1813 french occupation of the dominion of pomerania motifs from german folklore became increasingly prominent in his work an antifrench german nationalist friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate germanic culture customs and mythology he was impressed by the antinapoleonic poetry of ernst moritz arndt and theodor krner and the patriotic literature of adam mller and heinrich von kleist moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against france as well as by kleists 1808 drama die hermannsschlacht friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscapea first in the history of art\\nin  1812 a dilapidated monument inscribed arminius invokes the germanic chieftain a symbol of nationalism while the four tombs of fallen heroes are slightly ajar freeing their spirits for eternity two french soldiers appear as small figures before a cave lower and deep in a grotto surrounded by rock as if farther from heaven a second political painting  c 1813 depicts a lost french soldier dwarfed by a dense forest while on a tree stump a raven is percheda prophet of doom symbolizing the anticipated defeat of france\\nlegacy\\ninfluence\\nalongside other romantic painters friedrich helped position landscape painting as a major genre within western art of his contemporaries friedrichs style most influenced the painting of johan christian dahl 17881857 among later generations arnold bcklin 18271901 was strongly influenced by his work and the substantial presence of friedrichs works in russian collections influenced many russian painters in particular arkhip kuindzhi c 18421910 and ivan shishkin 183298 friedrichs spirituality anticipated american painters such as albert pinkham ryder 18471917 ralph blakelock 18471919 the painters of the hudson river school and the new england luminists\\nat the turn of the 20th century friedrich was rediscovered by the norwegian art historian andreas aubert 18511913 whose writing initiated modern friedrich scholarship and by the symbolist painters who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes the norwegian symbolist edvard munch 18631944 would have seen friedrichs work during a visit to berlin in the 1880s munchs 1899 print the lonely ones echoes friedrichs rckenfigur back figure although in munchs work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground\\nfriedrichs modern revival gained momentum in 1906 when thirtytwo of his works were featured in an exhibition in berlin of romanticera art his landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of german artist max ernst 18911976 and as a result other surrealists came to view friedrich as a precursor to their movement in 1934 the belgian painter ren magritte 18981967 paid tribute in his work the human condition which directly echoes motifs from friedrichs art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer a few years later the surrealist journal minotaure featured friedrich in a 1939 article by critic marie landsberger thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists the influence of the wreck of hope or the sea of ice is evident in the 194041 painting totes meer by paul nash 18891946 a fervent admirer of ernst friedrichs work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20thcentury artists including mark rothko 19031970 gerhard richter b 1932 gotthard graubner and anselm kiefer b 1945 friedrichs romantic paintings have also been singled out by writer samuel beckett 190689 who standing before man and woman contemplating the moon said this was the source of waiting for godot you know\\nin his 1961 article the abstract sublime originally published in artnews the art historian robert rosenblum drew comparisons between the romantic landscape paintings of both friedrich and turner with the abstract expressionist paintings of mark rothko rosenblum specifically describes friedrichs 1809 painting the monk by the sea turners the evening star and rothkos 1954 light earth and blue as revealing affinities of vision and feeling according to rosenblum rothko like friedrich and turner places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the sublime the tiny monk in the friedrich and the fisher in the turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic god and the infinite smallness of his creatures in the abstract language of rothko such literal detaila bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscapeis no longer necessary we ourselves are the monk before the sea standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night\\nthe contemporary artist christiane pooley gets inspired by friedrichs work for her landscapes reinterpreting the history of chile\\ncritical opinion\\nuntil 1890 and especially after his friends had died friedrichs work lay in nearoblivion for decades yet by 1890 the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day especially in central europe however despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality his lack of regard for painterly effect and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time\\nduring the 1930s friedrichs work was used in the promotion of nazi ideology which attempted to fit the romantic artist within the nationalistic blut und boden it took decades for friedrichs reputation to recover from this association with nazism his reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of modernism contributed to his fall from favour in 1949 art historian kenneth clark wrote that friedrich worked in the frigid technique of his time which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry clarks dismissal of friedrich reflected the damage the artists reputation sustained during the late 1930s\\nfriedrichs reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of hollywood directors such as walt disney built on the work of such german cinema masters as fritz lang and f w murnau within the horror and fantasy genres his rehabilitation was slow but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as werner hofmann helmut brschsupan and sigrid hinz who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work and placed it within a purely arthistorical context by the 1970s he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians\\ntoday his international reputation is well established he is a national icon in his native germany and highly regarded by art historians and art connoisseurs across the western world he is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity and according to vaughan a believer who struggled with doubt a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness in the end he transcends interpretation reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery he has truly emerged as a butterflyhopefully one that will never again disappear from our sight\\nwork\\nfriedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works in line with the romantic ideals of his time he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative it is likely that some of todays more literal titles such as the stages of life were not given by the artist himself but were instead adopted during one of the revivals of interest in friedrich complications arise when dating friedrichs work in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases he kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output however which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates'}, {'title': 'Gustave_Moreau', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'gustave moreau  6 april 1826  18 april 1898 was a french artist and an important figure in the symbolist movement jean cassou called him the symbolist painter par excellence he was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s he was among the most significant painters art historian robert delevoy wrote that moreau brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in jupiter and semele he was a prolific artist who produced over 15000 paintings watercolors and drawings moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies j k huysmans wrote  gustave moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty mysterious and new the female characters from the bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman his art and symbolism in general fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but beginning in the 1960s and 70s he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters\\ngustave moreau was born in paris and showed an aptitude for drawing at an early age he received a sound education at collge rollin now collgelyce jacquesdecour and traditional academic training in painting at the ecole des beauxarts in the early 1850s he developed a close friendshipmentorship with thodore chassriau and had some modest success exhibiting as the paris salon thodore chassriaus premature death in 1856 deeply affected moreau and he left paris to travel in italy 185759 returning with hundreds of copies and studies he made of old master paintings there in 1864 his painting oedipus and the sphinx received a great deal attention at the paris salon winning a medal and establishing his reputation he had continued success through the 1860s gradually gaining a select group of enthusiastic and loyal admirers and collectors although his painting prometheus received a medal at the salon of 1869 criticisms in the press were severe and he did not submit paintings to the salon again until 1876 permanently withdrawing after 1880\\nmoreau was decorated officier de la lgion dhonneur in 1883 somewhat misanthropic he grew increasingly reclusive in later years although he maintained a close circle of friends he was often reluctant to sell his work seldom exhibited and turned down a number of prestigious offers including an invitation to exhibit at the salon les xx in brussels 1887 rejected the post of a professor when he was elected to the ecole des beauxarts 1888 and offers to decorate buildings at the sorbonne 1891 it was only after the death of his friend lie delaunay in 1891 that he agreed to takeover delaunays studio at the ecole

1830 after the july revolution of 1830 he was appointed highway commissioner for the city of paris although the office was not highly revered his duties were more varied than the title suggest and he remained there until he retired in 1858 as a child moreau was of frail health beginning at about the age of eight moreau started drawing incessantly in 1837 he began attending the collge rollin collgelyce jacquesdecour in paris as a boarder but in 1840 when his older sister died at the age of 13 he was withdrawn from the school and lived a somewhat sheltered life with his parents his father encouraged and supported his artistic tendencies but was adamant that he received a solid classical education moreau learned greek latin and read both french and classical literature in his fathers rather substantial library he learned piano and was a very good tenor in 1841 he visited italy with his mother and relatives where he filled a 60 page album with drawings\\nvisiting museums and galleries in italy profoundly impressed moreau and influenced his resolution to pursue a career as an artist upon returning in 1841 he started attending a drawing studio in the evenings in 1844 he entered the private studio of franoisdouard picot a member of the cole des beauxarts who offered classes to aspiring young artists to prepare for the entrance examinations at the cole des beauxarts in 1846 moreau was admitted to picots formal class at the cole des beauxarts moreau had grand aspirations of winning the prestigious grand prix de rome but when he failed to make the final rounds in 1848 and 1849 he left the cole des beauxarts prematurely moreaus style soon drifted away from those favored by the academy however many of the basic beauxarts methods and concepts he learned would remain with him for the rest of his life as would his commitment to history painting\\nmoreau spent his time copying paintings in the louvre and was soon drawn to romanticism two contemporary artist he greatly admired were eugne delacroix and thodore chassriau both of whom lived and worked in his neighborhood chassriau had entered the private studio of the great neoclassical painter jeanaugustedominique ingres at the age ten and later spent time with ingres at the french academy in rome but in his late teens he turned away from neoclassicism to delacroix and romanticism chassriau never attended the cole des beauxarts but he was driven and hardworking and managed to establish a reputation for himself securing commissions and living a rather bohemian and sometimes turbulent life moreau developed a good friendship with chassriau seven years his senior and rented a studio near chassriaus he soon followed suit becoming something of a dapper man about town during this period attending the opera theater even singing at the social gatherings he frequented anecdotal accounts say moreau visited delacroixs studio around 1850 who was 28 years older than moreau but there is little evidence of a relationship beyond that\\nmoreaus father bought a townhome at 14 rue de la rochefoucauld in 1853 converting the top floor into a studio for moreau where he and his parents lived for the rest of their lives shortly before moving in moreau had started an ambitious canvas a scene of epic slaughter based on an episode from the odyssey titled the suitors 18521896 he worked on the painting on and off for the rest of his life even adding strips of canvas to enlarge the work to a monumental 385 x 343 meters but it was still unfinished at the time of his death moreau began exhibiting his work with some regularity in the 1850s he secured some commissions form the city for paintings with the help of his father he participated in the paris salon for the first time in 1852 presenting a pieta which was purchased by the state for 600 francs in the salon of 1853 he exhibited darius fleeing after the battle of arbela and song of songs both showing some influence of chassriau and the latter bought by the state for 2000 francs for the dijon museum there was no salon in 1854 although he received a commission from the state in 1854 for athenians being delivered to the minotaur in the cretan labyrinth which was shown at the 1855 paris worlds fair and purchased for 4000 francs for the bourgenbresse museum after a few short weeks of declining health in 1856

the young man and death in 1856 finished in 1865 and dedicated to chassriau\\nitaly 18571859\\nthe death of chasseriau in 1856 caused moreau in his grief to withdraw from public life concerned about his condition moreaus parents suggested he travel to italy again living in italy he found a renewed love for art he gained inspiration from the artists of the italian renaissance such as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo \\nmoreau left paris in october 1857 with his friend artist frdric charlot de courcy sailing from marseille to civitavecchia and on to rome he approached his time in italy as a period of extended study a compensation of sorts for his premature withdrawal from the cole des beauxarts in paris he approached his time in italy as a period of extended study a compensation for his premature withdraw from the cole des beauxarts in paris of sorts after a few days of getting oriented and taking in the sights he began studying and copying art in the city in earnest he spent the better part of two months in the sistine chapel copying figures from the ceiling seven or eight hours a day he copied the work of relatively obscure and unknown artist as often as the established masters he was particularly interested in examining complex grouping of multiple figures and compositional color schemes he also frequented the villa medici where he could work from live models and there he established friendships with other parisians studying in italy including elie delaunay henri chapu mile lvy and georges bizet he met a young edgar degas for whom moreau was to become something of a mentor while in italy in august 1858 he was joined by his parents his father having recently retired was particularly interested in the architecture in venice he developed a fascination with vittore carpaccio a little known artist at that time and copied several of his works visits were made to florence milan pisa and siena\\nthe second italian war of independence broke out in the spring of 1859 making the summer in naples and pompeii a tense period moreau largely copied the work of others in italy and produced only a few original works there examples include some large drawings on the theme of hesiod and the muse and a number of fine landscapes in watercolors painted en plein air in september 1859 moreau and his parents returned to paris with several hundred drawings and paintings back in paris degas painted a small portrait of moreau in 1860 that hung in moreaus studio for the rest of his life however their relationship began to drift as degas soon fell under the influence of douard manet and the impressionist while moreau stayed focused on history painting moreau once remarked to degas you pretend to be able to renew art through ballet to which degas replied and you think you will be able to do it by jewelry\\nsalon success and mid career 18601880\\nmoreau never married and very little information is known about his personal and romantic relationships in the past some biographers speculated that he was gay largely inferred from the fact that he was a bachelor a lack of information regarding women in his life and the sometimes effeminate or androgynous appearance of male figures in some of his paintings however more recent research and documents revealed a relationship with adelaidealexandrine dureux b guise 8 november 1835  d paris march 1890 that lasted over 30 years moreau apparently met alexandrine soon after his return from italy and in following years he produced many drawings and watercolors of her as well as romantic caricatures of the two of them walking on clouds together he subsidized an apartment for her on rue nortedame de lorette just a few blocks from the townhome where he lived with his parents their relationship was very discreet and known by only a few in his closest circle his mother was aware of their relationship and apparently fond of her as indicated by a stipulation in her will that provided an annuity for alexandrine should gustave die before her he designed her tombstone engraved with their interlaced initials a and g which is located near his family plot where he was interned with his parents\\noedipus and the sphinx one of his first symbolist paintings won a medal at the salon in 1864 its style revealed his close study of the work of vittore carpaccio mantegna and giovanni bellini its firm outlines and detailed modeling are typical of the works that brought him success with critics and the public for the remainder of the decade moreau quickly gained a reputation for eccentricity one commentator said moreaus work was like a pastiche of mantegna created by a german student who relaxes from his painting by reading schopenhauer the painting currently resides in the permanent collection at the new york metropolitan museum of art\\nin the 1870s disturbed by criticism that his work had become formulaic he stopped exhibiting for a few years while he concentrated on renewing his art in 1876 he completed salome dancing before herod which announced a more painterly style that would characterize his later works\\nhe was made a chevalier de la lgion dhonneur in 1875 and was promoted to an officier de la lgion dhonneur in 1883\\nteaching and later career 18811898\\nmoreau increasingly withdrew from society in his later years he stopped exhibiting at the salon and refused to exhibit abroad however he continued to produce paintings and sporadically exhibited his work in other venues such as the 1889 paris worlds fair he occasionally entertained guest at his townhome and was known for his engaging conversation but visitors were rarely allowed in his studio to see his work he was exceptionally cultivated erudite and a voracious reader with a personal library of over 1600 volumes compared to other artist who had achieved his level of success in paris at that time he live a fairly modest lifestyle edgar degas who lived nearby and occasionally still interacted with him described moreau in later years as a hermit who knows what time the trains leave\\nart collector anthony roux commissioned several artist to produce works based on jean de la fontaines fables in 1879 including moreau pauljacquesaim baudry juleslie delaunay gustave dor henri gervex henri harpignies ernest hbert nlie jacquemart eugne lami jeanfranois raffalli flix ziem and others the results were all exhibited together in 1881 at cercle des aquarellistes in paris the exhibit was celebrated by the critics of the day and moreaus work who completed 25 pieces more than any other was judged far superior to majority of the others moreau alone was commissioned to continue the series in the only private show in his life 64 la fontaine fables with six other large watercolor were exhibited at the goupil amp cie gallery in 1886 were tho van gogh was manager and later in london the series was exhibited again posthumously in paris in 1906 and one was donated to the muse national gustave moreau remarkably after rouxs death in 1914 63 of the watercolors were sold to a single collector and although regarded as among his finest work they were not exhibited by the buyer or their heirs for well over 100 years and known only from some early low quality black and white reproductions nearly half of the paintings later disappeared during the reign of the nazis and have not resurfaced\\nmoreau and his mother were very close throughout his life she lost her hearing in her later years and gustave communicated with her by writing notes on slips of paper often giving his thoughts regarding the paintings he was working on his assistant henri rupp saved many of the notes which are archived at the museum and provide significant insight into moreaus ideas on his art the death of his mother at the age of 82 in 1884 caused him deep despair for a while he could not spend nights alone in the family townhome and took refuge at the apartment of alexandrine dureux nearby ultimately the room where his mother died was left unchanged and became something of a shrine that he never entered six years later he was at alexandrine dureuxs bedside when she died on 28 march 1890 after five months of deteriorating health her death also affected him greatly he bought back several watercolors that he had given her over the years and some furniture from her heirs which he placed in a room of his townhome in her memory both deaths reinforced his isolation and he buried himself in his work which took on an even greater melancholic edge\\nmoreau was elected into the cole des beauxarts in 1888 but he declined professorship and a class and the director paul dubois exempted him from all formal obligations however on his death bed lie delaunay a close friend since their time in rome asked moreau to succeed him and direct one of the main ateliers at the school moreau reluctantly took the class on a temporary basis in october 1891 but later accepted the appointment of professor and atelier director in january 1892 at the age of sixfive moreau was a contrasting individual from the academic artists at the cole des beauxarts including lon grme lon bonnat william bougueruau jeanpaul laurens lucolivier merson and juleseugne lenepveu about 125 students passed through moreaus alter between 1891 and 1898 among them were pierre marcelbronneau simon bussy charles camoin henri evenepoel jules flandrin raoul du gardier jacques grber charlesfranoisprosper gurin henri matisse albert marquet henri manguin edgard maxence theodor pallady lon printemps georges rouault and fernand sabatt\\nhere during his last years he displayed remarkable talents as a teacher moreaus class quickly attracted the most progressive and adventurous students as early as 1896 rogermarx wrote the fires of insurrection have been lit in the very heart of the cole des beauxarts all the rebels against routine all those who wish to develop in their own individual way have gathered under the shield of gustave moreau  moreau made no attempt to impose his own views or style on his students he gave them a stimulating atmosphere and intelligent encouragement to follow their own ideas he took his pupils to the louver to study and copy the masters unheard of at the cole des beauxarts matisse said it was an almost revolutionary attitude on his part to show us the way to the museum students were invited to his home on sunday afternoons but not allowed to see his studio and occasionally he visited his students\\nyesterday at half past one i was walking along the embankment when i met gustave moreau who like myself was on his way to see a good chum of mine henri matisse a delicate painter skilful in the art of using grays he suffers from violent neuralgia in his arm and can hardly walk somehow or other we reached the quai saintmichel where matisse was strolling about waiting for him we made our way painfully up the stairs of that old house at no 19 there we were at last in the small studio full of torn wallpaper and knickknacks all gray with dust moreau said to me we are the jury he sat down in an armchair with me beside him and we spent a delightful hour he told us the whys and the wherefores of his likes and dislikes matisse showed us his entries for the champs de mars exhibition ie salon de la socit nationale des beauxarts some ten canvases with beautiful colors practically all of them still lifes and they provided the starting point for talk about everything connected with art including music moreau has remained astonishingly young there is nothing professorial about him not a hint of pedantry he is a friend henri evenepoel\\ngeorges rouault said he was not a professor in the commonly accepted sense but a man whom it did you good to emulate rouault was already a student when moreau took the class and he soon recognized rouaults exceptional talent and rouault always held moreau in the highest esteem half a century later rouault still spoke of him with the same veneration with the same sympathy and cordiality as if moreau were still living and as if rouault himself were still a raw youth at the feet of a mentor whose judgments he trusted implicitly both in art and in life matisse said gustave moreaus great quality was to regard the mind of a young student as needing to develop continuously throughout his life and not to push him to get through the various scholastic examinations matisse had been denied admission to the cole des beauxarts but moreau saw him drawing in the public courtyard of the school and invited him to join his class exempting him from the entrance examination matisse soon became the central figure among a faction of students in moreaus studio that developed into the fauvist albert marquet said as early as 1898 matisse and i were working in what was later to be called the fauve manner exemplified by fauve nude painted in moreaus atelier for decades his pupils credited the significance of their teacher recalling his prophetic comments that were often taken to heart the more elementary your means are the more your sensibility shows through one must think color one must have it in the imagination nature in itself is nothing it merely gives the artist an occasion to express himself art is the unflagging pursuit through plastic means of expression and inner feeling \\nmoreaus concerns for the fate of his lifes work started in the 1860s he began an inventory his paintings about 1884 and the death of delaunay in 1891 exemplified what could become of an artist work after their death moreau arrived at the idea of leaving his house to the state as a museum and remodeled his townhome in 1895 expanding his small studio on the top floor into a much larger exhibition space after about a year of declining health moreau died of stomach cancer on 18 april 1898 and was buried at the cimetire de montmartre in paris in his parents tomb he left instructions stipulating that his death was not to be announce in the press his funeral was to be a very small simple service and any flowers were to be placed on the grave of alexandrine dureux not his own the government was hesitant to accept the estate artists house museums were very rare at that time and unprecedented in france his assistant henri rupp was significant in organizing the estate and persuading the state to take it over\\nart\\ni believe neither in what i touch nor in what i see and only in what i feel my brain and my reason seem to be ephemeral and of dubious reality my inner feeling alone appears to me eternal and unquestionably certain gustave moreau\\nexoticism\\ngustave moreaus education in classical drawing did not stop him from experimenting with different styles of art by traveling to other countries such as italy or holland and reading publications moreau was able to develop his unique form of art the most important publications moreau owned were the grammar of ornament by owen jones le costume historique by august racinet and le costume by frederick hottenroth all these influences led moreau to draw not only humans but animals and architectural monuments moreau started his career drawing classical art but by incorporating exotic images he developed a mysterious and unique form of art\\nlegacy\\nduring his lifetime moreau produced more than 15000 paintings watercolors and drawings due to his reluctance to sell his work when he died he still owned 1200 paintings and watercolors and 10000 drawings which he left to the state the muse national gustave moreau at 14 rue de la rochefoucauld 9th arrondissement opened to the public on january 14 1903 with his former student georges rouault appointed curator\\n a visionary like none other he made the land of dreams his own but from the madness of his dreams a sense of anguish and despair found its way into his works a master sorcerer he cast a spell over his period enthralled his contemporaries and brought a tinge of idealism to the skeptical and practical finde sicle under the influence of his painting a whole generation of young men have grown up doleful and languid their eyes obstinately turned to the past and the magic of other days a whole generation of men of letters especially poets have become nostalgically enamored of slender salomes glittering with jewels of muses carrying blood drained severed heads jean lorrain\\nhis influence on symbolism in his lifetime and the decade following his death was tremendous gustave moreau was the man of the moment aloof independent solitary he yet became fashionable in high society and was taken up in masonic and occult circles art historian jean selz wrote he was a symbolist before the symbolist and the most extraordinary of all of them he influenced the next generation of symbolists particularly leading figures in belgian symbolism such as jean delville and fernand khnopff and odilon redon in france redon said of his work moreau a bachelor produced the work of an elegant bachelor strictly sealed up against the shocks of life his work is the fruit of it it is art and nothing but art and that is a saying a good deal\\nmany poets and writers of the day revered moreaus paintings thophile gautier joriskarl huysmans stphane mallarm paul de saintvictor and emile zola all praised his work it was a common practice at the time for poets to paraphrase in verse paintings they admired and the paintings of gustave moreau were among the most lauded of the symbolist poets thodore de banville jos maria de heredia claudius popelin jean lorrain henri cazalis and others wrote of moreaus work in poetry\\ninterest in his work remained fairly high in the first decade of the 20th century and occasional exhibitions of his paintings were held in the 15 years following his death however when the museum opened there was some disappointment in the audiences of the time in seeing the large numbers of drawings and unfinished paintings and not a museum full of highly finished masterworks in oils and attendance began to drop off after the opening with the rise and prevalence of realism impressionism and postimpressionism followed by the onslaught of fauvism cubism futurism expressionism abstract art and dada moreau and most symbolist painting not realized in an expressionist style appeared less relevant to modernism and was all but forgotten after world war i what little fame and notoriety moreau had was largely related on his status as the teacher of rouault and matisse and the fauvist one of the only exhibitions in the 40 year period between 1918 and 1958 was a show held in paris in 1926 centered around moreau and his pupils\\nmoreau and surrealism\\nandr breton famously used to haunt the museum and regarded moreau as a precursor of surrealism in his manifesto of surrealism he listed forerunners of the movement poets and painters who could pass for surrealist and included moreau with picasso de chirico and a short list of other examples breton wrote in 1961 my discovery of the gustave moreau museum in paris when i was sixteen years old shaped my likes and loves for the rest of my life it was there in certain womens faces and figures that i had the revelation of beauty and love georges bataille wrote enthusiastically of his work calling him a precursor of surrealism salvador dal was also a great admirer of moreaus work and a regular visitor to the gustave moreau museum to those i love i recommend visiting the museum going and plunging into this twilight world where risen from the gulf of erotic and scatological obsession constellations of precious stones float like so many promises of archangelical redemption it was at the gustave moreau museum in 1970 where dal holding a wax replica of his own head on a silver platter chose to make the public announcement of his plans to open his own museum teatromuseo dal in figueras spain max ernst is known to have used reproductions of moreaus work on occasion to create collages\\nandre breton advocated gustave moreaus work throughout his life whenever he had the opportunity in his writings and introducing other writers and artist to the museum in paris at a time when moreau and symbolism had largely drifted into obscurity breton sponsored a exhibition of symbolist drawings in paris at the dateaulavoir gallery in 1958 the exhibit has been identified as a significant event in reestablishing recognition of moreaus work it was a small overconfidential exhibition but it succeeded in getting the attention of the right curators and in 1961 no less than the louvre museum and the museum of modern art mounted exhibitions of moreaus paintings which in turn were followed by a landmark exhibition of symbolism le groupe des xx et son temps in brussels in 1962 and by the 1970s exhibitions and monographs on moreau and symbolism were appearing with some regularity\\nthe japanese artist yoshitaka amano known for works such as final fantasy angels egg and vampire hunter d was inspired by moreaus style amano said in an interview that when he was first experimenting with styles to try to find his own he would try to mimic the works of moreau'}, {'title': 'Lee_Krasner', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'lenore lee krasner born lena krassner on october 27 1908  june 19 1984 was an american abstract expressionist painter with a strong speciality in collage she was married to jackson pollock although there was much crosspollination between their two styles the relationship somewhat overshadowed her contribution for some time krasners training influenced by george bridgman and hans hofmann was the more formalized especially in the depiction of human anatomy and this enriched pollocks more intuitive and unstructured output\\nkrasner is now seen as a key transitional figure within abstraction who connected early20thcentury art with the new ideas of postwar america and her work fetches high prices at auction she is also one of the few female artists to have had a retrospective show at the museum of modern art\\nearly life\\nkrasner was born as lena krassner outside the family she was known as lenore krasner on october 27 1908 in brooklyn new york she was the daughter of chane ne weiss and joseph krasner russianjewish immigrants from shpykiv a jewish community in what is now ukraine the couple fled to the united states to escape antisemitism and the russojapanese war and chane changed her name to anna once she arrived lee was the fourth of five children including her sister ruth and the only one to be born in the united states\\neducation\\nfrom an early age krasner knew she wanted to pursue art as a career her career as an artist began when she was a teenager she specifically sought out enrollment at washington irving high school for girls as they offered an art major after graduating she attended the womens art school of cooper union on a scholarship there she completed the course work required for a teaching certificate in art krasner pursued yet more art education at the national academy of design in 1928 completing her course load there in 1932 when krasner attended high school she almost didnt graduate based on her grade in art which was the subject she attended the school for and was only given 65 to pass the class \\nby attending a technical art school krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the old masters she also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures there are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few selfportraits and still lifes since most of the works were burned in a fire one image that still exists from this period is her self portrait painted in 1930 now at the metropolitan museum of art she submitted it to the national academy in order to enroll in a certain class but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a selfportrait en plein air in it krasner depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature she also briefly enrolled in the art students league of new york in 1928 there she took a class led by george bridgman who emphasized the human form\\nkrasner was highly influenced by the opening of the museum of modern art in 1929 she was very affected by postimpressionism and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the national academy in the 1930s she began studying modern art through learning the components of composition technique and theory she began taking classes from hans hofmann in 1937 which modernized her approach to the nude and still life he emphasized the twodimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons throughout her classes with hofmann krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism also known as neocubism during the class a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which krasner and other students would have to work she typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings she typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors the still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds\\nhans hofmann was very negative his former student said but one day he stood before my easel and he gave me the first praise i had ever received as an artist from him he said this is so good you would never know it was done by a woman she also received praise from piet mondrian who once told her you have a very strong inner rhythm you must never lose it\\nearly career\\nkrasner supported herself as a waitress during her studies but it eventually became too difficult due to the great depression in order to continue provide for herself she joined the works progress administrations federal art project in 1935 working in the mural division as an assistant to max spivak her job was to enlarge other artists designs for largescaled public murals as murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public however the abstract art krasner produced was undesirable while happy to be employed she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with figurative images created by other artists throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an abstract mural as soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the wnyc radio station the works progress administration turned into war services and all art had to be created for war propaganda krasner continued working for war services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in brooklyn and manhattan she was intensively involved with the artists union during her employment with the wpa but was one of the first to quit when she realized the communists were taking it over however by being part of this organization she was able to meet more artists in the city and enlarge her network\\nafter she quit she joined in 1940 the american abstract artists while a member she typically exhibited cubist still life in a blackgridded cloisonne style which were highly impastoed and gestural she met future abstract expressionists willem de kooning arshile gorky franz kline adolph gottlieb mark rothko barnett newman clyfford still and bradley walker tomlin through this organization she lost interest in their usage of hardedge geometric style after her relationship with jackson pollock began\\ncareer\\nkrasner is identified as an abstract expressionist due to her abstract gestural and expressive works in painting collage painting charcoal drawing and occasionally mosaics she would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings she also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature as a result her surviving body of work is relatively small her catalogue raisonn published in 1995 by abrams lists 599 known pieces\\nher changeable nature is reflected throughout her work which has led critics and scholars to have different conclusions about her and her oeuvre krasners style often alternates between classic structure and baroque action open form and hardedge shape and bright color and monochrome palette throughout her career she refused to adopt a singular recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood subject matter texture materials and compositions of her work often by changing her work style often she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction despite these intense variations her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style texture rhythm and depiction of organic imagery krasners interest in the self nature and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works she was often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasized the importance of her biography since she claimed her art was formed through her individual personality and her emotional state\\nearly 1940s\\nthroughout the first half of the 1940s krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature throughout the 1930s the new york painting scene consisted of a very intimate group of artists that studied each others efforts but was not yet shown in galleries the 1940s marked a transition from an age of innocence to a modernist mindset of pure expression she was highly affected by seeing pollocks work for the first time in 1942 causing her to reject hofmanns cubist style which required working from a human or still life model she called the work produced during this frustrating time her grey slab paintings she would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months overpainting scraping or rubbing paint off and adding more pigment until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint buildup she eventually would destroy these works which is the reason there is only one painting that exists from this time period krasners extensive knowledge of cubism was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant in the fall of 1945 krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with hofmann although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation\\nlittle images 19461949\\nbeginning in 1946 krasner began working on her little image series commonly categorized as mosaic webbed or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image these types of paintings totalling around 40 she created until 1949 the mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas since krasner used a drip technique many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she was reinterpreting pollocks chaotic paint splatters her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable personal script of krasners creation these works demonstrate her antifigurative concerns allover approach to the canvas gestural brushwork and disregard of naturalistic color they have little variation of hue but are very rich in texture due to the buildup of impasto and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas these are considered her first successful images that she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model the relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel in her small studio space in an upstairs bedroom at the springs\\nmany scholars interpret these images as krasners reworking of hebrew script in an interview later in her career krasner admitted to subconsciously working from right to left on her canvases leading scholars to believe that her ethnic and cultural background affected the rendering of her work some scholars have interpreted these paintings to represent the artists reaction to the tragedy of the holocaust others have claimed that krasners work with the war services project caused her to be interested in text and codes since cryptoanalysis was a main concern for winning the war\\nwhen she completed the little image series in 1949 krasner again went through a critical phase with her work she tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s there is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created blackandwhite hybridized monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950 these were the paintings that betty parsons saw when she visited the springs that summer causing the gallerist to offer krasner a show in the fall between the summer and the fall krasner again had shifted her style to color field painting and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made the betty parsons show was krasners first solo exhibition since 1945 after the exhibition krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings\\nearly collage images 19511955\\nby 1951 krasner had started her first series of collage paintings to create these them krasner pasted cutandtorn shapes onto all but two of the largescale color field paintings she created for the betty parsons exhibition in 1951 this period marks the time when the artist stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor to make these images she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied she then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism by using many different materials she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat the act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies krasners expression since these acts are aggressive she explored contrasts of light and dark colors hard and soft lines organic and geometric shapes and structure and improvisation through this work these collage paintings represent krasners turn away from nonobjective abstraction from this period onwards she created metaphorical and contentladen art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes\\nfrom 1951 to 1953 most of her works were made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner by ripping the paper instead of cutting it the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hardedged shapes in her previous works from 1953 to 1954 she created smallersized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by pollock many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used her partners unwanted canvases some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage form others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between themselves which was lacking in their actual relationship by this time period by combining their works together by 1955 she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support using either masonite wood or canvas these works were first exhibited by eleanor ward at the stable gallery in 1955 in new york city but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from clement greenberg\\nearth green series 19561959\\nduring the summer of 1956 krasner started her earth green series while she started making this work before pollocks death they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger guilt pain and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died the intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop along more liberated lines of her selfexpression and pushed the boundaries of conventional developed concepts of art through these largescale action paintings krasner depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plantlike forms and anatomical parts which often allude to both male and female body parts these forms dominate the canvas causing it to be crowded and denselypacked with bursting and bulging shapes the pain she experienced during this period is illustrated through the principal usage of flesh tones with bloodred accents in the figures which suggest wounds the paint drips on her canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control both necessary for portraying her emotions\\nby 1957 krasner continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical she used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition she also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent\\nin 1958 krasner was commissioned to create two abstract murals for an office building on broadway she created two collage maquettes which depicted floral motifs for two entryways of the building these murals were later destroyed in a fire\\number series 19591961\\nkrasners umber series paintings were created during a time when the artist was suffering from insomnia since she was working during the night she had to paint with artificial light rather than daylight causing her palette to shift from bright vibrant hues to dull monochrome colors she also was still dealing with the death of pollock and the recent death of her mother which led her to use an aggressive style when creating these images these muralsized action paintings contrast dark and light severely since white grays black and brown are the predominant colors used evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas there is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic to paint on such a large scale krasner would tack the canvas to a wall these images no longer implied organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes\\nprimary series 1960s\\nby 1962 she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plantlike shapes these works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point their palettes often contrast with one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants she continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm fell and broke her right wrist in 1963 since she still wanted to work she began painting with her left hand to overcome working with her nondominant hand she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images the gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained\\nafter recovering from her broken arm krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her earth green and umber series paintings often these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation not blatantly related to krasners known emotional state floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern\\nby the second half of the 1960s critics began reassessing krasners role in the new york school as a painter and critic who greatly influenced pollock and greenberg prior to this her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with pollock since he served as such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning pollock in some capacity this reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in london at the whitechapel gallery in 1965 this exhibition was more wellreceived by critics in comparison to her previous shows in new york\\nin 1969 krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with gouache these works were named either earth water seed or hieroglyphics and often looked similar to a rorschach test some scholars claim that these images were a critique of greenbergs theory about the importance of the twodimensional nature of the canvas\\nlate career\\nthroughout the 1960s and 1970s the painters work was significantly influenced by postmodern art and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication\\nstarting in 1970 krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hardedge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another she painted in this style until about 1973 three years later she started working on her second series of collage images she began working on these after cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940 after saving a few krasner decided to use the rest in a new series of collages in this work the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint the hardedged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message the differences between the old drawings and new structures are highly exaggerated all of the collages titles from this series are different verb tenses interpreted as a critique of greenbergs and michael frieds insistence on the presentness of modern art this series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the pace gallery it is also considered a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older\\nkrasner and pollocks mutual influence on one another\\nalthough many people believe that krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture pollocks home life and career she never in fact stopped creating art while their relationship developed she shifted her focus from her own to pollocks art in order to help him gain more recognition due to the fact that she believed that he had much more to give with his art than she had with hers\\nthroughout her career krasner went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique revise or destroy the work she would produce because of this selfcriticism there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s\\nkrasner and pollock both had an immense effect on each others artistic styles and careers since krasner had learned from hans hofmann while pollock received training from thomas hart benton each took different approaches to their work krasner learned from hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while pollocks training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing krasners extensive knowledge of modern art helped pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be he was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan additionally krasner was responsible for introducing pollock to many artists collectors and critics who appreciated abstract art such as willem de kooning peggy guggenheim and clement greenberg pollock helped krasner become less restrained when making her work he inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work\\nkrasner struggled with the publics reception of her identity both as a woman and as pollocks

sculpture by carving objects for him out of wood for his safety his father gave him clay to model animals sparking his interest in art at a young age youngs father died when he was about seven years old his fathers death provided young with the motivation to become a successful sculptor his mother never remarried but was forced to sell the factory for less than half its worth due to financial concerns despite this agnes was able to provide for the living expenses of her family\\nhis family moved into a small house in salt lake city where young began school at eleven years old his mother bought him a woodcarving kit from which he carved a fourinch bas relief of julius caesar from a fence post after seeing the piece a book salesman called him a genius leading his family to call him the genius due to mediocre grades and always feeling behind his classmates young quit school after eighth grade he spent time reading and studying about art making friends with other young aspiring artists his childhood friends included john held jr and lee greene richards he created his first sculpture when he was thirteen at a young age young found formal education to be a waste of time young said that the only thing he learned that was of any value to him was that he should look at the point where a line would end rather than the point of the pencil however despite his disinterest in formal education he read avidly with favorite authors being ralph waldo emerson and montaigne early influences from the mormon families around him led him to be disinterested in maintaining lds church activity examples of these influences included abuse of the law of plural marriage and excessive piety among church members\\nyoung was athletic and participated in baseball and football teams however after an injury during a football game he broke his left arm and after it was incorrectly reset and then rebroken to be properly set his left arm remained slightly smaller than his right for the entirety of his life his early interest in athletics influenced the subject of his art as he often sculpted and depicted athletes competing in various sports the most prominent sport being boxing he also developed his interest in nature and bird watching which further influenced themes and subjects of his art his uncle introduced young to ranch life in which he became extremely interested his mother was adamant that he pursue a different career although young did not become a rancher themes of ranching and the american west were frequent in his art young learned about the art style of jeanfranois millet from reading magazines which taught him about form space light and movement in art an article about millet convinced young to quit school get a job and take art lessons determined to become a sculptor young realized that he had not sculpted since he was five years old so he decided he may have better luck being an illustrator\\nsalt lake city and new york education\\nrather than attend ninth grade young chose to pursue an artistic education under local artist james taylor harwood john hafen and edwin evans he had initially applied to the university of utah but his application was denied because he had not graduated high school instead young worked in a curio shop and a stationary shop to make money for lessons with harwood however he was delayed in attending lessons due to a necessary appendectomy harwood was unimpressed by young believing that he was a lazy artist and did not work hard youngs philosophy however was that there is no virtue in working hard but rather thinking hard furthermore young liked to quickly sketch an observation which he would later turn into a drawing but being a traditionalist harwood viewed this technique as cheating and an artistic crime although young had not yet sculpted in class one day young and a classmate sculpted the mask of laocon with details from the david and laughing faun young was not trained in sculpture and had not sculpted since he was five years old despite his lack of experience his instructors praised his sculptures and his natural talent however he would not sculpt again until he studied in paris young saved money earned as a salt lake tribune portrait artist but took his subsequent demotion to an engraver as a blow to his ego\\nusing the money he saved he attended the art students league of new york between 1899 and 1901 in new york young was fascinated by the industrial revolution and decided that he would make art to reflect the themes of the industrial revolution at the art students league young took classes with george bridgeman and kenyon cox he began using realist techniques he would look at artistic models quickly and then attempt to draw his or her memorized features although young disliked bridgeman as an instructor young maintained a spot as second in the class in contrast young greatly admired cox as an instructor during his time in new york he suffered from insomnia which he attempting to remedy by reading shakespeare and magazines young lived on a tight budget and spent most of his time studying or attending art exhibits after running out of money young had to return to salt lake city after eight months instead of his intended nine\\nparis education\\nin salt lake city young worked for the salt lake herald as an engraver and did some drawings for deseret news even though he contracted the spanish flu young became manager of the photoengraving shop for the herald and saved enough money to travel to paris france in 1901 to study at the acadmie julian young received extra money to study from his mother who had arranged for a settlement of a part of brigham youngs estate as well as donations from family and members of the lds church\\nhe studied until 1905 where he studied with jeanpaul laurens and jeanantoine injalbert unimpressed by the traditional styles taught in paris young did not believe he learned anything at the acadmie in france until 1903 when he was able to work more independently and develop his realistic style he started studying painting and after achieving personal goals painting and after more artistic education from a trip to italy he returned to studying sculpture and etching in 1903 young indicated that one must learn to be thick skinned in class to be able to withstand the criticism of both professors and other students most of his instruction in anatomy came from independent study of books he found that he could not stomach anatomy classes at the ecole des beauxarts not because of cadavers because he had not yet made it to that point in the lectures but because of the overwhelming stench of unshowered students and sweat which gave him unbearable headaches\\nyoungs most important etching in paris was the forge rue st jacque it was exhibited in 1903 bringing public attention to youngs etchings his first original sculptures the shoveler and the man tired were completed in 1903 young did not agree with the use of models in his sculpting because he believed it took away from the naturalness of the piece for his sculptures he found that sketches and observation over time made for more natural results and a better depiction of motion he nervously sent man tired and the shoveler to the american art association show in 1903 and achieved great success his sculptures were featured in the paris herald in an article about the american art association show his sculptures were sent to the new salon in paris for liberal art were placed in the main gallery and received critical acclaim he spent all of his time looking at art in exhibitions or sketching on the street which garnered him criticism from his classmates for being lazy young however felt that he could learn more by observing rather than by working and studying in the studio\\nduring the summer of 1903 young returned to salt lake city having run out of money in salt lake city young continued to sketch fortunately for young his mother borrowed enough money for him to spend another two years studying in paris in new york on his way to paris young participated in an amateur boxing match and broke his thumb which prevented him from sculpting for a few months so he attempted water coloring instead he had some modeled drawings hung in the paris old salon which led him to experiment drawing with more models his model bovetarthur was displayed in the new salon young frequently used this man bovetarthur as a model for his work while he was in paris young did a parody piece called the toilet but it was never exhibited and young destroyed it in 1905 he destroyed some other work that was not accepted to salons he later admitted regretting destroying his work and never destroyed another piece heber j grant president of the lds european church mission at the time gave young money to cast some of youngs statues in bronze during his last two years studying in france he visited galleries and studios of wellknown artists continuing to develop his style of realism mahonri young was one of the first young american sculptural realists\\ncareer\\nmahonri young returned to utah in 1905 needing to find a way to make a living due to his lack of success and financial troubles young considered years 1905 to 1910 his five years of exile his first commission was a butter sculpture for frost creamery for the utah state fair called the dairy maid later young established a mildly successful art class at the ymca but the class was canceled after one of his students started an art club that took away his students in 1906 he managed to maintain some private lessons young hoped to make a commission by making and selling a bust of bh roberts but he did not have money to bronze it until 1908 however roberts first wife refused to buy the bust because it did not adequately portray her husbands personality young finally received more commission when he and lee greene richards completed a mural for the isis movie theatre using themselves as models for the characters this was the first outside mural done in utah and the only one done by young however news stories about the murals kept being killed leading young to believe there was a conspiracy against realist artists however there were few career prospects in the united states as the art scene was dominated by conservative juries who were unwilling to take a chance on unknown artists and were uninterested in unique or groundbreaking styles museums and exhibitionists wanted to showcase academic art and did not want to showcase american art consequently young found it difficult to sell or exhibit his work in the united states he found little success during his first five years back in the united states however a group of realists called the eight hosted an independent exhibition in 1908 in philadelphia igniting the success realist artists could find in the united states\\nyoung improved his reputation by making a bust of alfred lambourne in early 1907 the lds church granted mahonri young permission to create a lifesize sculpture of joseph smith the first president of the lds church using his death mask after the lds church rejected his work young offered to redo the piece and make an additional statue of hyrum smith joseph smiths brother these statues were accepted and currently reside on temple square despite financial troubles young married cecelia sharp on february 19 1907 young had initially seen sharp while both in paris where sharp had been studying piano they had not yet met and sharp had to travel back to utah due to her fathers health began to fail in utah they attended the same lds church where sharps father was a bishop but they had not yet met because sharp was five years older than young young and sharp met in 1906 while sharp was giving private piano lessons in salt lake city and fell in love young made a bust of sharp in 1906 polished and beautiful the bust was different than anything he created during his career\\nyoung and sharps first child cecelia agnes young known as agnes or aggie was born on april 25 1908 continually aware of the revolt of the eight young traveled to new york in 1908 and 1909 to determine whether he could be successful in new york after he presented an idea to construct a seagull monument to the lds church they were excited about the project but were unable to fund it he instead sculpted a frieze to go above the lds gymnasium this was the last project he completed in utah before he moved to new york young felt that he could relate to the styles and the goals of the eight so he and his family moved to new york in 1910 in new york young was a founding member of the society of american etchers he did not find success until 1912 which was a turning point in his career in 1911 young won the helen foster barnett prize for bovetarthur a laborer displayed at the national academy his first new york exhibition was held in 1912 stevedore was shown at the metropolitan museum in new york in the same year young was elected to the national academy of design as an associate moreover in 1912 young proposed the seagull monument to the lds church a second time stressing the personal importance of the monument to presiding bishop of the lds church charles w nibley the lds church offered young a contract for the completion of the seagull monument offering him a 200 per month advance for his living expenses mahonri bill sharp young was born on july 23 1911 in new york\\nfollowing the seagull contract young was offered a contract to create art for a hopi indian exhibition for the american museum of natural history he visited arizona new mexico and utah to get inspiration and then returned to new york to complete the project with his colleague howard maccormick young was offered some commission to create dioramas for navajo and apache tribes as well the seagull monument was unveiled and dedicated on temple square on october 1 1913 a member of the association of american painters and sculptors and because of the similar artistic goals and interests young became friends with some members of the ashcan school and joined them in arranging the 1913 armory show which sought to introduce patrons to new styles and movements in art the armory show included realism and introduced more abstract styles such as cubism young disliked abstract art styles in fact young believed the emerging styles of surrealism and abstract expressionism that began to appear later in his life were a greater threat than communism in 1915 young became a member of the brooklyn society of etchers today known as the society of american graphic artists or saga the societys objective was as it is today to advance the fine works of american etchers youngs six etchings noon ensign peak the main digger which was listed for 18 kite fliers pavers and the sand pit were all exhibited at the brooklyn society of etchers first exhibition at the brooklyn museum ny in 1916 also in 1915 he featured nine pieces at the panamapacific international exposition where he was awarded the silver medal youngs apache sculptures were unveiled at the american museum of natural history in 1916 cecelia sharp died of cancer in 1917 after which young returned to paris to continue studying art he resided in paris from 1925 to 1927 in paris he taught students one of whom was mary tarleton tarleton and young maintained a romantic relationship for a few years tarleton 27 years his junior confessed her love to young but refused his many marriage proposals their relationship and consistent correspondence came to an end in 1930 in 1923 young was elected to the national academy of design as an academician in 1924 young unveiled his navajo statues at the american museum of natural history in new york\\nin 1926 e w marland commissioned a statue of a pioneer woman he invited twelve artists to submit sculptures to be considered for the monument young submitted a sculpture but lost to bryant baker young considered this the greatest disappointment of his career youngs statues of prize ring boxer bronzes were shown at the rehn galleries in new york in 1928 their first exhibition in 1929 young crafted a bronze of joe gans for winfield sheehan a fox film executive at the time young married dorothy weir daughter of painter j alden weir on february 17 1931 and promptly moved to the weir family farm in connecticut young maintained a studio at the weir estate which has become weir farm national historic site young first met weir at 1921 at a dinner to discuss plans for the phillips memorial gallery one of the books for the gallery was intended to be dedicated to weirs father when young returned to paris to teach and work on his art from 1925 to 1927 they were reacquainted and became friends after returning to new york young proposed marriage to weir a few times but she hesitated having never been married and feeling responsibility to care for her aging stepmother\\nin 1932 young competed in the art competitions at the 1932 summer olympics with eight boxing statues the knockdown which he had sculpted in the 1920s in paris won the gold medal for sculpture in 1934 he began teaching at the art students league the same year his etching pont neuf was featured in fine prints of the year 1933 in 1941 life magazine called him the george bellows of american sculpture industry and agriculture a statue of factory worker with tools and a statue of a farmer sharpening his blade were displayed at the 1939 new york worlds fair these large sculptures stood at the fairs entrance\\nthis is the place monument\\nmahonri young had a unique relationship with the lds church since his teenage years he did not attend church follow the word of wisdom or pay tithing to the lds church however he did admire several lds church leaders and was proud of his pioneer heritage despite his lack of activity in the lds church he lobbied heavily to work on several projects for the church largely considered to be his most important artistic work young was especially proud of this is the place monument located at this is the place heritage park in the foothills of salt lake city the most artistically significant relief on the monument depicts the donner party the monument was intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of brigham young and the mormons arrival in the salt lake valley in 1847 as early as 1935 a committee had been chosen to consider artists proposals of the monument young did extensive research and sketching for the project confident he would be awarded the chance to create the monument after lobbying the committee for almost five months he returned to new york frustrated that he had not yet secured the project he decided to lobby us senators from utah to gained federal funding for the project which offended committee member john d giles giles told young that he could not give him a contract because they were waiting on funding from the lds church however giles was actually stalling time to find a different artist to complete the project the committee decided to make the monument proposal a competition which worried young because of his experience with the pioneer woman competition john fairbanks a younger artist had already completed prominent statues and memorials for the lds church he was youngs fiercest competition lds president heber j grant chose youngs design in 1939 because it highlighted prominent figures brigham young heber c kimball and wilford woodruff rather than a covered wagon as in the fairbanks design\\nyoung was awarded 50000 to build the monument in 1939 when he was 62 years old after he was granted the contract many of the artistic qualities sought by young were vetoed by representatives from utah state government the lds church and descendants of pioneers for example young wanted pioneer leaders in realistic clothing like they would have worn when entering the salt lake valley on july 24 1847 however youngs vision of leaders like brigham young and heber c kimball in suspenders and bloomers was deemed undignified instead pioneer leaders were portrayed in heavy formal overcoats young worked on the statues at weir farm assisted by spero anargyros the monument was dedicated on july 24 1947 on the onehundredth anniversary of brigham youngs party reaching the great salt lake valley it is the largest sculpted monument in utah even though young was paid 50000 for the monument he believed that he was owed 11000 extra according to the terms of the contract he was angry when he was denied the money and eventually became frustrated enough to write to the president of the lds church george a smith directly george q morris of the quorum of the twelve apostles severely reprimanded young for contacting smith and young was never paid the extra 11000 young resented this alleged contract breach for the rest of his life\\nin 1947 young was elected a member of the american academy of arts and letters dorothy weir died on may 28 1947 young continued to live there after her death his last major work was for the state of utah he created a sixfoot monument of brigham young seated for the statuary hall in the united states capitol building the work was unveiled in washington dc in 1950 he carved this work at the american academy in rome italy during a visit to utah in the same year he was made an honorary member of the sons of utah pioneers club in 1955 young participated in the armory show commemorative exhibition in new york city in january 1957 young had a serious stroke and in october 1957 he had an ulcer attack young died in norwalk connecticut on november 2 1957 from the result of bleeding ulcers complicated by pneumonia he was eighty years old he was buried in the salt lake city cemetery at the young family plot next to cecelia young\\nstyle and works\\nalthough mahonri young was taught the classical style which prevailed in the french art institutes of the time and was surrounded by colleagues who sought to reject the classical style with impressionistic and postimpressionistic styles young was disinterested in depicting idyllic or naturalistic images and was more concerned with depicting the realities of life that surrounded him consequently youngs work is often associated with social realism as his work depicted laborers immigrants minorities the west and mans interaction with nature at the time young felt isolated by his traditionalist instructors and colleagues who penned youngs work as dishonest the size of his work ranged from larger monuments to small sculptures which he typically did in the social realist style his most recurring subject matter included animals native americans the boxing ring ranch life and laborers young greatly admired the work of cyrus dallin and youngs work often had parallels to that of dallins\\nmahonri young was versatile in his subject matter and methods yet his works were united in powerful elegance he was proficient in various mediums and techniques such as etching drawing watercolor oil gouache and sculpture which included his lesser known work on medals and reliefs even though he is known for his sculpture he always kept a sketchbook with him and would use pen and ink oil and watercolor to depict scenes he saw on the farm however while art critic frank jewett mather praised youngs drawings etchings and sculpture he qualified youngs painting as average suggesting that young may have commenced painting at too old of an age or perhaps did not approach it with the same effort and care with which he approached his other mediums additionally compared youngs work to that of jeanfranois millet honor daumier and constantin meunier though young vehemently denied it some critics accused young of imitating millets work youngs work particularly his earlier pieces was also heavily influenced by auguste rodin youngs sculpture of fighting boxers right to the jaw is characteristic of rodins style with its curves and opposing diagonal movements youngs experience as a sketch artist for the salt lake tribune gave him a spontaneous style that he believed benefited his art young excelled in depicting figures in motion and the psychological nuances of gesture rather than emphasize light appearance and technical skill as had prevailed in traditionalist art young preferred to emphasize rhythm balance movement form and design\\nlegacy\\nmahonri youngs career lasted more than fifty years with his works displayed in over fifty museums and galleries in the united states and europe upon his death his estate constituted 320 pieces of sculpture 590 oil paintings 5500 watercolors 2600 prints and thousands of drawings young was the first utah artist to have his work displayed in the metropolitan museum of art in new york moreover young received nearly every award offered to artists

lithograph selfportrait in 1954 and worked in etchings during his time at rca in 1965 the print workshop gemini gel approached him to create a series of lithographs with a los angeles theme hockney responded by creating the hollywood collection a series of lithographs recreating the art collection of a hollywood star each piece depicting an imagined work of art within a frame hockney went on to produce many other portfolios with gemini gel including friends the weather series and some new prints during the 1960s he produced several series of prints he thought of as graphic tales including a

explorations within his personal photo albums he referred to as joinersfirst using polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm commercially processed colour prints using polaroid snaps or photolabprints of a single subject hockney arranged a patchwork to make a composite image because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times the result is work that has an affinity with cubism one of hockneys major aimsdiscussing the way human vision works some pieces are landscapes such as pearblossom highway 2 others portraits such as kasmin 1982 and my mother bolton abbey 1982\\ncreation of the joiners occurred accidentally he noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wideangle lenses he did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted while working on a painting of a living room and terrace in los angeles he took polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together not intending for them to be a composition on their own on looking at the final composition he realised it created a narrative as if the viewer moved through the room he began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique\\nover time however he discovered what he could not capture with a lens saying photography seems to be rather good at portraiture or can be but it cant tell you about space which is the essence of landscape for me anyway even ansel adams cant quite prepare you for what yosemite looks like when you go through that tunnel and you come out the other side frustrated with the limitations of photography and its oneeyed approach he returned to painting\\nother technology\\nin december 1985 hockney used the quantel paintbox a

yorkshire landscape and david soon began using a wacom pad and pen directly into photoshop\\nsince 2009 hockney has painted hundreds of portraits still lifes and landscapes using the brushes iphone and ipad application often sending them to his friends in 2010 and 2011 hockney visited yosemite national park to draw its landscape on his ipad he used an ipad in designing a stained glass window at

jugglers and dancers and his own exhibitions within the de young museum and the royal academy of arts\\nhockneys earlier photocollages influenced his shift to another medium digital photography he combined hundreds of photographs to create multiviewpoint photographic drawings of groups of his friends in 2014 hockney picked the process back up in 2017 this time using the more advanced agisoft photoscan photogrammetric software which allowed him to stitch together and rearrange thousands of photos the resulting images were printed out as massive photomurals and were exhibited at pace gallery and lacma in 2018\\nplein air landscapes\\nhockney returned more frequently to yorkshire in the 1990s usually every three months to visit his mother who died in 1999 he rarely stayed for more

where he was the keynote speaker at the opening press conference '}, {'title': 'Domenico_di_Bartolo', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'domenico di bartolo birth name domenico ghezzi born in asciano siena was a sienese painter who became active during the early renaissance period as documented on text by famous painter writer and historian giorgio vasari domenico di bartolo was the nephew of well reputed italian artist taddeo di bartolo who is featured in vasaris lives of the most excellent painters sculptors and architects by the early 1400 domenico di bartolo was one of the most influenced sienese artist by the new florentine style of painting during the time that he was active and working domenico was the only sienese painter to have received commissions by clients in florence domenico was also employed by lorenzo vecchietta otherwise referred to as lorenzo di pietro to work alongside him for the fresco the care of the sick which is today considered a masterpiece of the pilgrims hall in the hospital santa maria della scala siena\\ndomenico first surfaced into the world of early renaissance art in 1420 he along with several other unknown sienese artists was documented to be part of a restoration project to paint the siena cathedral he is first recorded as a master in 1428 in a list of the painters guild ruolo dei pittori his first surviving signed and dated work comes from 1433 the madonna of humility and four musicmaking angels in 1433 he also painted the virgin and child surrounded by saints a year later in 1434 domenico provided a design for a pavement plaque in the cathedral of siena based on a drawing of the emperor sigismund who sojourned at siena from 1432 to 1433 from 1435 to 1440 domenico was engaged in a fresco commission for the cathedrals sacristy this work however was interrupted in 1438 which gave domenico time to go to perugia to paint an altarpiece for the monastery church of santa giuliana which is now displayed in the galleria nazionale dellumbria in 1437 he also took on a contract to execute an altarpiece for the monks of saintagostino at asciano by 1439 domenico had been paid to work in the hospital of santa maria della scala siena\\nthe frescoes executed in the pellegrinaio of the hospital between 1439 and 1440 represent scenes of the institutions history and good works they are the artists last finished works and are considered to be his masterpieces for the most part domenicos works were based in perugia and his only known activity outside of siena may have been at florence as his first biographer giorgio vasari records works carried out by him in the carmine and santa trinita in january 1440 domenico di bartolo was married to antonia pannilini and on 18 february 1446 antonia pannilini was officially mentioned as a widow\\nearly life\\ndomenico di bartolo was born in asciano which was a province in siena in the italian region tuscany domenico carried the family name ghezzi he was a nephew of taddeo di bartolo who a reputable painter featured in giorgio vasaris lives of the most excellent painters sculptors and architects there is only one document that could have been associated with domenico before 1428 as observed by johns hopkins art history professor carl strehlke in the opera del duomo payments for 1420 a certain domenico di bartolo otherwise unidentified is compensated two soldi  a medieval italian silver coin for his work as a gharzone di bottega the term gharzone may define someones position ranging from a fullfledged apprentice to a mere helper or worker if the document indeed were to refer to domenico he was most likely at the beginning stages of his artistic training and only eight years later in 1428 he finally made a standing for himself by being acknowledged in the painters guild on the basis of this payment document in 1420 it is most probable that domenico was born sometime between 1400 and 1405 however more accurate sources that record his exact date of birth have yet to be discovered today\\ncarl brendon strehlke further elaborates that the payment documents for the opera del duomo show that at the time the opera was overseeing several important sculptural commissions a new pulpit for the council of siena the decoration of the cathedral pavement and most importantly the construction of a new baptismal font it is recorded that some of the most progressive artists in all of tuscany were involved in these projects names which include ghiberti donatello francesco di valdambrino domenico di niccolo de cori and jacopo della quercia it is therefore not a surprise that domenicos first extant painting the madonna of humility of 1433 possessed strong sculptural qualities art historians such as strehlke and bruce cole claim that it is highly likely that during the time that domenico worked as a gharzone for the operas projects he received many influences from many of the mentioned sculptors other contemporary artists that existed during domenico di bartolos time were stefano di giovanni and giovanni di paolo who were already active master painters by their early twenties both di giovanni and giovanni di paolo placed emphasis on more of the linear and emotive qualities of drawing whereas di bartolo conceived of forms in rounded masses\\nmadonna of humility 1433\\ndomenico di bartolos madonna of humility of 1433 is recorded to be the artists first ever commissioned piece of artwork renaissance scholar bruce cole refers to domenicos madonna of humility with angels as one of the loveliest works of the early sienese quattrocento when observed comparatively the painting traces back to hints of masaccio as well as sculptor jacopo della quercia jacopo was likely to have influenced domenicos painting more directly for the practical reason that the two artists were in closer proximity to each other and in addition they had the experience of working together for the opera of duomo it is hence also entirely possible that jacopo della quercia could have even provided some guidance in the creation of domenico di bartolos work this type of mentorship is comparable to that of lorenzo ghiberti in florence who as stated in the commentary provided the same kind of assistance to the painters in that city during his time another situation that can attest to jacopo and domenicos professional relationship comes from the written record that after jacopo was elected to be the overseeing operator of the cathedral of sienas works domenico di bartolo secured himself works to paint in the sacristy scholars such as bruce cole commend domenicos madonna of humility because it is unlike any sienese painting of its time this is for several technical and stylistic reasons all of which give insight into domenico di bartolos keen eye for adaptation and observation from fellow artists in particular much of the art critiques give recognition to domenicos painting because of its strong sculptural references many of which align with jacopo della quercias style\\nthe composition of the painting is centered with a very volumetrically and triangularly depicted madonna behind her are five angels who form a semicircle that gives further movement and depth into the painted space referring back to several of the madonna panels by masaccio that have survived until today a similarity between them and domenicos madonna is that the large figures created dominating geometrical forms that give the overall image a strong sense of sculptural stability and gravity art historians also mention that the color palette of the painting is of particular skill and thoughtfulness the green pink and blue of the madonnas robes in contrast with the paleness of the angels garments and the pale green of the cloth on the infant all come together to display a trait that was peculiar to the sienese paintings that were produced around the 1400s such peculiarity comes from the fact that the mixing of these colors were more definitive to florentine styled art hence color geometric orientation costumes and faces all come together to suggest that domenico would have received his early apprentice training from someone in siena with strong florentine influences two possible candidates that bruce cole introduces are paolo di giovanni fei or taddeo di bartolo logistically taddeo would especially be a likely possibility because of his apparent florentine styles in his art having this kind of mentorship would have most definitely have encouraged domenico to observe and attempt to adapt the latest florentine artistic styles techniques trends and developments more so than any other sienese painter of his time domenico well understood masaccios well recognized realistic and straightforward style of painting in particular he was able to incorporate masaccios styles into his own paintings without distorting or misrepresenting them domenico di bartolo must have visited pisa and florence sometime in the late 1420s where he would have witnessed paintings executed by masaccio who was considered by giorgio vasari to be one of the best painters of his time as well as the first great italian painter of the quattrocento renaissance period masaccio was commended for his refined skills in imitating nature recreating lifelike movements in his subjects as well as his consistent success in creating a convincing three dimensionality to his paintings domenicos observations of masaccios painting would have proved to be an educational experience as he later is seen to utilize a type of artistic technique called circulararc composition within the madonna of humility the five angels are arranged in a semi circle creating significantly more tangible space for the presentation of the virgin without however affecting the flat picture plane caused by the isocephalic distribution of the angels heads this kind of semicircular composition was used by masaccio in works such as the adoration of the magi for the pisa altarpiece this technique was considered to be an effective way of organizing a large number of figures that exist in a complicated narrative scene into a single simple geometric configuration\\nin regards to sculptor jacopo della quercia domenicos madonna of humility shows hints of adaptation by displaying similarities to jacopos madonna in the fonte gaia both portray a new kind of gothic flexibility in the draper which creates soft pockets of shadows that add to a new kind of weightiness to the figure and to the overall image domenicos madonna of humilityeventually ended up contributing significantly more to florentine than to sienese art during the time that the painting was released to the public appreciation and recognition from sienese art critics were minimal to serve as evidence that there had been some kind of a partnership to exist between jacopo and domenico john popehennessys research confirms that the major works of domenico for the cathedral of siena were commissioned at the time when jacopo was the overseeing operational director of the opera del duomo when jacopo quercia left siena in 1435 he had selected two counsellors to proceed his job domenico was one of the two witnesses to approve of jacopos nomination decisions\\nin the painting the virgin is also depicted in a way that had been popularized in siena by gentile da fabriano an italian painter who was best known for his international gothic painting style other artists who depicted the virgin in a similar manner during this time were giovanni di paolo for his branchini madonna of 1427 and andrea di bartolo for his madonna of humility yet there are several artistic elements within domenicos madonna of humility that derive from techniques frequently observed in florentine works the frontal view of the virgin who is presented in an asymmetric composition is said to have been inspired by masaccios madonna of humility foreshortened halos and virgins crown were rare during the time that domenico di bartolos painting was executed and can only be found in the pisa altarpiece executed by masaccio there too is an illustration of the baby with fingers in his mouth which strongly recalls back to masaccios pisa altarpiece which illustrates the christ child eating grapes domenicos madonna of humility successfully models lights and darks within the flesh tones and this too is done in the style of masaccio however renowned british art historian john popehennessy states in his articles that domenico di bartolo cannot be a fully masacciesque painter whilst painters like filippo lippi or andrea di giusto depict their figures to stand up in a stiff manner those of domenico di bartolo possess a certain gothic flexibility hennessy observes a certain fluid quality in bartolos paintings for example the madonnas knee is bent and the angels to the left of the madonna have curved bodies as a result it is infinitely more likely that domenico drew stronger influences for the paintings details from jacopo della quercia\\ndomenico di bartolo was praised for capitalizing on florentine elements and was considered an incredibly talented sienese painter because of how early on in his career he had managed to adopt the florentine renaissance style giorgio vasari notes that sometime in his career domenico di bartolo painted altarpieces for florentine churches which confirms such appraisals and evaluations that domenico was competent enough to analyze and infer from the florence aspects of renaissance art yet many sienese and general renaissance art critics consider domenico to still be a sienese painter with acquired florentine tastes and not a progressive florentine painter his work of the madonna of humility is ultimately considered sienese and many art historians conclude that at this time domenico himself was a young artist who was attracted and eagerly open to new ideas but perhaps had not yet assimilated such ideas to a profound meaning\\nthe theology that seems to have influenced the madonna of humility aligns with preacher and proclaimed saint bernardino albizzeschi otherwise referred to as bernardino da siena 13801444 canonized 1450  albizzeschi is considered to be one of the major religious and political figures to have shaped the outcomes of domenico di bartolos artworks and to have influenced the overall success of domenico as an artist during his time bernardino albizzeschi was considered to be one of the most followed loved and vilified men in italy he himself was not unfamiliar with the art world during his time and was known to favor canonized artistic images from the sienese trecento and therefore influenced the subsequent production of many sienese artworks in domenicos madonna of humility the common salutation on the painting  ave maria is replaced by the term ave stella maris which means hail star of the sea although this ancient attribute originated early on in christian etymology for the name mary there is no existing record of an author before bernardino who had written so intricately about the terms meaning\\nin regards to who actually commissioned domenico di bartolos first work the answer remains entirely ambiguous however researcher carl strehlke observes and concludes that two likely candidates to consider in this aspect are casini and bartoli both of whom were bishops of siena from 1408 and 1427 respectively both casini and bartoli were close to bernardino da siena and back then bartoli was the rector of the hospital of santa maria della scala from 1410 to 1427 bernardino promotes bartolis position to a bishop as a means to draw closer the relationship between the citys church and the hospital santa maria della scala siena\\nthe sigismund plaque 1434\\nin 1434 domenico also conceived and designed a fresco panel with the representation of emperor sigismund enthroned sigismund holy roman emperor for the siena cathedral however the specific date of completion remains unknown art critic and historian cesare brandi has praised domenicos fresco panel in his writings because of its florentine qualities similar to domenicos madonna of humility which was completed less than a year before the commission of the panel had begun to take form the plaque of emperor sigismund is drawn with a simple semicircle composition brandi comments of the architecture of the fresco panel for although it is not entirely correct in perspective it can be successfully viewed from below carl strehlke comments on the image of the emperor as a hierarchal presentation of emperor sigismunds court because he like a saint or madonna is depicted with significantly greater height in comparison to the other figures in the art piece domenico also utilizes symmetry principles for the frescos composition as observed the man with the hat on the left is mirrored by another on the right there are aspects of this fresco panel that can be seen again in domenicos later on works such as the fresco of the papal grant of privileges to the hospital in the santa maria della scala siena\\nadult career\\nfrom the works completed by domenico in the later part of his thirties only three paintings from these years have managed to survive first a perugia altarpiece for santa giuliana second a signed and dated madonna and child in the johnson collection and finally a small madonna del refugio in siena domenico also frescoed the walls of the sacristy in the siena cathedral however a very tiny fragment of them have managed to survive until today researcher carl strehlke mentions in his dissertations that such frescoes in the cathedral were in such poor state of maintenance that its subjects and story could not be identified it is said that domenico produced an average of one fresco per year in which he seems to have produced little other work during this time for these frescoes however domenico seemed to turn away from his florentine influences and interests as he began to reflect more traditional gothic styles this is especially apparently for an altarpiece painted in 1438 for st giuliana perugia from 1440 to 1444 domenico produced one of his most significant works another masterpiece which were a series of frescoes for the pilgrims hotel in the ospedale di santa maria della scala siena the frescoes were said to have been commissioned by giovanni buzzichelli who was the hotels rector the frescoes illustrate daily life as well as the history of the sienese hospital domenico was assigned five scenes three with everyday life episode and the other two with events that have occurred from the history of the hospital\\nsiena cathedral sacristy frescoes\\nwhilst domenico is best known for his frescoes for the santa maria della scala hospital in siena the sacristy frescoes he had completed for the siena cathedral played an integral part of establishing domenicos name as a rising fresco painter in siena domenico began to work on the sacristy frescoes one month after his mentor sculptor jacopo della quercia was named the operational director of the cathedrals artistic restoration project as mentioned previously it is clear that some form of a partnership had existed prior to jacopo della quercias election because of the efficient timing in which domenico had been summoned to complete artworks for the cathedral however domenico was only able to produce to the cathedral one fresco a year for strehlke and other researchers observe that domenico must have been occupied with other commissioned works almost none of these frescoes in the cathedral have been able to survive until today\\nmadonna and child enthroned 1437\\nin 1437 four years after the madonna of humility domenico di bartolo painted a madonna and child giorgio vasari identifies the panel painting madonna and child enthroned as a fragment of an altarpiece for the high altar of the santa maria del carmine florence e as observed by art historian carl strehlke the pointed shortening of the upper edges and the low viewpoint of the virgins abdomen are all indications that the paintings composition had originally possessed different dimensions the sides of the panel seem to have been planed and the lower edge cut it remains unknown exactly where domenico was residing during the time that he was painting this piece three possible locations are siena florence or perugia for there are no documents that record commissions domenico had received outside of these three mentioned locations\\nscholar bruce cole observes that the two largely depicted figures the madonna and the child seem to have the same awkward but compelling force that one can spot in masaccios paintings straying away from the more popular and predominant characteristics in sienese paintings domenicos painting of the madonna and child carefully avoids any elegant expressions of beauty instead the two individuals are depicted to be unsophisticated and modest there is a stark emotional contrast in facial expressions between the child and his apprehensive mother some possible sources of inspiration for this painting could have been the works of ambrogio lorenzetti for similarities in the tender and fearful body gesture of the mother along with the protecting and intertwining with the baby is evident in addition the madonnas spread out right hand in domenicos painting can be traced present to several of the hands featured in ambrogios paintings\\nsanta maria della scala 14391444\\nbetween 1439 and 1444 domenico di bartolo participated in the decoration of the pilgrims hall in the hospital of santa maria della scala where he followed the artistic styles of artist lorenzo vecchietta and consequently produced six frescoes all of which were signed by domenico himself as a result this five year commission from the hospital became a huge proportion of domenicos midthirties artistic career whilst six frescoes can be identified as executed by domenico little decorative works of the hospital has managed to survive until today much of these frescoes including ones done by other sienese artists are in extremely poor condition in which the subjects and contents of the frescoes are sometimes impossible to identify vecchietta introduced to the art world of siena a kind of naturalistic style that domenico soon followed however domenicos paintings in the hospital still demonstrated a slightly more gothic style and approach his interdisciplinary style which quotes major florentine artists an ontherise sienese painter and his own gothic elements show a deep awareness for a kind of new artistic language of the renaissance period\\nsanta maria della scala siena was one of europes first hospitals and whilst it is now a museum on display it is still one of the oldest hospital buildings surviving today the hospital is conveniently located across both the siena cathedral and the opera del duomo where domenico also completed commissioned works around the same time the hospital was also at one point in time one of the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in siena the hospitals significance extended beyond serving as the central ward for the city and its surrounding territories it also functioned as a charitable institution the hospital was facilitated by a wide and diverse range of committees that were considered prominent citizens in particular the committee included main artists who employed their own group of painters and sculptors to help decorate the wards and the church within the building some of the earlier contributors to the hospital from the trecento period include ambrogio lorenzetti and pietro lorenzetti the hospital became the ultimate destination to host meaningful sienese art during the time that domenico di bartolo was employed to paint sections of the hospital the primary artist in charge of decorating the interior frescoes was bartolomeo bulgarini each fresco that was to be produced would display some kind of attribution to the hospitals philanthropic work domenico was but a minor artist to contribute to the artistic works within the building the six frescoes he did produce however were acknowledged by many art historians to be unique and incorporative of gothic styles consequently one could never mistaken domenicos frescoes to be executed by a florentine during this time domenico began to display greater interest in his own native art and many of the paintings were carried out with strong sienese elements\\nthe frescoes that domenico produced were located on the walls of the pellegrinaio di santa maria della scala which served as a ward for sick patients at the time pellegrinaio is alternatively referred to as the pilgrims hall and the art that decorates the halls interiors serves to represent as a strong proof of artistic development over the progressive years since the hospital had first been built in 1268 the project to decorate the pilgrims hall was first proposed by giovanni di francesco buzzichelli 14341444 giovanni is the one who summoned both vecchietta and domenico di bartolo to carry out the project both of them successfully renovated the hall in a way that depicts realities of lively daily existence as mentioned by strehlke no documentation of a commission for this hospital wall is known to exist he also observes that although the frescoes done by domenico di bartolo as well as vecchietta that have managed to survive until today present a unified pictorial scene details such as changes in the framing and challenges with the architecture of the hospital show that adaptations were made during the execution of the artworks it is unclear what position domenico occupied in the hospitals decoration and there are no records that he served at the planner or director of the project\\ncare of the sick\\ndomenicos first of his six frescoes is named the care of the sick which is signed by domenico with latin inscription and dated to 1440 the fresco shows with impressive detail the interior layout of the hospital ward doctors and nurses are depicted assisting the patients as well as carrying out other generous deeds the fresco also depicts in the center foreground the washing of the patients feet directly inferring to the wellknown image of christ washing the feet of his disciples throughout the whole painting domenico vividly brings out the color of the costume and its well crafted dcor because of such imitation to a real location domenico is said to have followed the works of vecchietta where both artists pave way into a whole new area of descriptive realism to the world of sienese art other painters at the time such as gentile da fabriano and pisanello might have depicted landscapes to be realistic or naturalistic but they were consistently known to create images that came out of fantasy and creativity it was therefore new to the art world for both domenico and vecchietta to produce images that seem to imitate a specific location the frescoes by domenico are also one of the first works done in sienese art that includes visual clues for its viewers\\neducation and betrothal of the foundlings\\nthe second most recognized fresco produced by domenico was named education and betrothal of the foundlings the entire basis of which the painting is orientated upon depends almost entirely on the architectural formation the painting depicts foundlings being betrothed under a detailed elaborate building with grand arches because of the dominating architectural layout the figures within the fresco are all formed and placed to be in a mathematically accurate spatial construction in which all of the orthogonals join together at the single vanishing point on the paintings horizon what makes this fresco peculiar for its time is its measurable mathematically expressed space which is a quality that was rarely produced in sienese painting during the first half of the quattrocento without a doubt domenicos decision to depict one of his frescos with such measured accuracy must have been influenced by realists of florentine painting such as masaccio masolino da panicale and filippo lippi still bruce cole writes about this fresco as one that stays eccentric and stylistically distant to domenicos sienese ancestors and florentine contemporaries cole writes that the fresco is a peculiar blend of realism and fantasy of immediacy and distance because of this the overall effect of the picture counteracts its realistic layout some of the most minute details in the education and betrothal of the foundlings can be found in the floor tiles rugs decorated robes and floor to ceiling moldings\\nthe last fresco\\ndomenico was unable to finish all six frescoes in time domenico began to have complications in his relationship with the hospital after he was unable to deliver a completed sixth fresco in addition to this the hospital had also commissioned domenico to produce a madonna della misericordia of which he was also unable to finish strehlke presents documents that prove that domenico was put on probation and his payroll was reduced strehlke suggests that a strong reason for domenico being unable to finish his work was due to illness of which he shortly died upon falling sick\\nfinal years\\ndi bartolos last ever dated commission was the fresco of the coronation of the virgin in the cancelleria di biccherna for the palazzo pubblico of siena he began to paint four angel heads but his work was interrupted by his death in 1445 soon after the fresco was completed by another sienese artist sano di pietro'}, {'title': 'Julian_Ritter', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'julian ritter september 19 1909  march 4

somewhat stormy relationship with his dealers and preferred to deal directly with collectors about this time ritter successfully set out to build a group of patrons who could provide financial

ritters neardeath experience catalyzed two years of intense painting during this period ritter was arguably at the peak of his artistic expression he was already a fulfilled artist who saw himself as

the demands of his collectors and his need for money ritter continued painting nudes portraits and occasional clown compositions\\nritter had a show in late 1975 at the howard e morseburg galleries on

adult life  ritter led the life of a hedonistic artist some family members recount that he did frequent catholic churches to reflect although his paintings were not overtly religious many of his works did have a mystical quality one example is the clown funeral in it clowns are bearing one of their own eyes closed but wearing a beautiful clown smile ritter appears in selfportrait in the painting some compare this painting to el grecos el entierro del conde de orgaz the burial of the count of orgaz\\nfriends and patrons\\nritter had a number of interesting friends george morgan the son of frank morgan the wizard of oz who was wealthy from the family business distributing angostura bitters was a drinking buddy john coleman who taught at art center and his family were also close friends who visited the edgewater way house frequently\\nritter befriended chick rosenthal who lived in the same hollywood bungalows in the 1930s and maintained that friendship until rosenthals death rosenthal accompanied ritter to new york in a van in 1941 when ritter was offered the oneman show at the newhouse galleries\\nritter began a longterm friendship with rudolph axford from venice california in the mid1950s axford shared ritters conservative politics and love of boats and was a ritter patron who accumulated many pieces of his work\\ngreg autry was another friend and patron autry met ritter in 1983 after he purchased a fake ritter in a laguna beach gallery autry both commissioned paintings and purchased other examples of ritters work autry purchased the silver slipper collection of ritters paintings from the summa corporation in a closedbid auction in the late 1980s\\nart\\nalthough ritter was best known for his oil paintings of nudes clowns and portraits he also worked in other media including penandink with watercolor charcoal and cont crayons and painted other subjects including portraits landscapes and complex compositions he also liked doing caricature often drawing cartoons rather than sending letters to friends ritters style changed over the course of his life\\nart historian and awardwinning author phyllis settacase barton wrote of ritter\\nlabeling the work of julian ritter is not easy because his genius is not readily defined this is because for most of his life he has painted women as though he were exploring a garden  with eyes lips and nipples painted like blue red and pink blossoms his earlier work also includes lots of clowns many of which he painted with introspection and compassion  generally to the exclusion of their surroundings  telling us that his mind heart and eye were in league with the human being beneath the costume behind the makeup as an adventurer into human nature he painted portraits each flavored with the spirit of the sitter each embodying the effervescence of the cycle of life in viewing all of these paintings  nudes clowns portraits  we begin to become aware that julian ritter has been on a journey  not just a physical journey  but a speculative one in which he has really been exploring himself but the quintessential julian ritter comes to us through a series of sumptuously painted monumental pictures which i choose to call lifescapes his promethean story about how he has travelled from spiritual darkness into the shimmering world of rapture julians magnificent vertical work which he calls the black hole tells us the story of julians transgression and his penance\\none example of a mixedmedia watercolor and chalk is bachelors housekeeping painted in 1939 the painting was at the deyoung museum in san francisco in 1963\\nritter had a steady presence in the los angeles art scene with exhibitions and showings from 1947 through 1975 when he had his last major gallery showing at the howard e morseburg galleries in los angeles his work was typically on display in any given week at some gallery in southern california as evidenced through display ads in the sunday los angeles times he was also frequently listed in the calendar section of the los angeles times after this ritter had a sufficient number of patrons to support his lifestyle without the need for gallery showings\\nportraits\\nritter painted a number of prominent californians he also painted many actors especially while employed at warner brothers where he would paint an actor in his current role for instance he painted paul muni in his role as zola in the life of emile zola he also painted ruby keeler clara bow claudette colbert olivia de havilland and veronica lake\\nnudes and showgirls\\nritter painted several variations of the horizontal nude pose other nudes include paintings of janet boyd a successful las vegas showgirl who he also painted as a showgirl in his painting the gibson girl boyd later wrote to ritter i only got to be with you a few years but wonderful memories i have and will cherish not every girl gets to be a ritter model i loved every moment posing for you the early mornings working in the studio in santa barbara are happy memories for me and because your works of me will keep me young and beautiful forever there were many other nudes using various models\\nritter painted a number of nudes of his first wife the actress francesca chesley ritter also painted a couple of nudes of his second wife hilde the latter remain in the family collection\\nhe also painted many showgirl paintings the most famous of which is ruby a painting of an africanamerican girl he made several showgirl paintings using a model named leeann which were also commercially successful\\nclowns\\nalthough he had painted clowns before ritter started painting a series of unusual or tender clowns in the summer of 1948 his first visit to a circus was in 1949 ritter said of his clown paintings i dont need to see clowns my clown portraits are more like human portraits in clown makeup they are a combination of my imagination and my memory of faces or even my own face\\nritter was commissioned in the early 1950s by an art gallery on ventura blvd in the san fernando valley to paint a set of small 8x10 clowns called the helter skelter clowns the clowns included dilly dally flim flam pitter patter and helter and skelter these were reproduced for the mass market in 1958\\nritter also painted a series of clowns based on mr whimsey a clown with his dog the uo colson company of illinois commissioned ritter to paint a set of these paintings for a calendar he painted several more mr whimsey paintings some of which were part of the silver slipper collection\\nritter also painted a number of clown compositions featuring groups of clowns egclown band and clown funeral and clown with nude or showgirl montages some of these feature a single clown with his arm around a showgirl others portrayed a single nude surrounded by a variety of clowns and others were groups of clowns\\nritter tired of painting his commercially successful clowns and made the painting clown funeral to announce the end of his clown paintings after that he painted only the occasional clown composition or a clown painting commissioned by a patron\\nlandscapes\\nalthough he was known primarily as a figurative painter ritter painted a number of landscapes particularly when he was in san blas mexico and when he made his pacific voyage ritter said of the san blas paintings that they informed him with a new sense of color the south pacific seemed to further transform ritters paintings in much the same manner as it had on paul gauguin decades earlier though these never achieved the commercial success of his nudes and clowns they were arguably amongst his best paintings\\nlifescapes\\nritter was a man who lived in his emotions his paintings have been described as a visual record of his emotional life nowhere is this more true than in the paintings art historian phyllis settacase barton called lifescapes\\nit could be argued that the first of these lifescapes were the clown compositions the painting clown band is no less a joyful presentation of life than ritters later work gods children clown funeral was a deeply introspective look with ritter in selfportrait carrying the body of a fallen clown  his announcement that he was no longer interested in painting the clowns that had brought him so much commercial success the montages of clown with either nudes or showgirls shows the duality in all of us  the sensuality and eroticism of the female form with the detached folly of the accompanying clowns\\nbut the true lifescapes were those works that ritter painted when he had the patronage that allowed him to eschew dealing with galleries  ritter finally started painting the great compositions which he saw in his visions these works were described as mystical looks into the core of existence and the meaning of life many of these were painted during and after the voyage that almost took his life but which also opened his mind and heart to see deeper and more introspective subjects and expressions paintings of the voyage revealed the absolute terror in the hollowedout eyes of the subjects the mystical paintings revealed a faith that higher powers were at work\\none critic wrote julian is a man who has seen life absorbed it and now presents it sweeping and majestic paintings presented the very essence of ritters emotions the carousel was a complicated composition exploring mans spiritual nature ritter dealt with mans hypocrisy in the sunday preacher ritters man on the cross was a deeply personal view into ritters emotions as he painted his selfportrait onto the cross one critic wrote of the piece undoubtedly it is a daring and modern interpretation of life it is a work which will cause considerable controversy but what great artist hasnt caused that what artist of any note has not or will not speak his own mind through his pictures\\nwhen ritter and kokx separated in the summer of 1984 ritters work became more dark expressing the aloneness he felt in his partners absence\\nritters work changed again when he went to maui building again on the spiritual art historian phyllis settacase barton wrote of these paintings in the glowing panoramic scenes powerfully and prayerfully julian ritter lets us in on some of his most intimate secrets eases us into his precious discoveries and shares with us deepest concerns\\nsilver slipper casino collection\\nthe silver slipper casino collection started in february 1950 when ritter sold 13 framed nude paintings for 1000 to bill moore the owner of the last frontier hotel by 1962 33 paintings of nudes showgirls clowns and clownnude montages adorned the walls of the upstairs theater\\non april 4 1955 the last frontier hotel became the new frontier hotel under the management jacob kozloff in 1967 howard hughes bought both the new frontier hotel and the silver slipper casino\\nafter hughes death howard hughes summa corporation sold both the silver slipper casino and the frontier hotel to the elardi family in 1988 and divested itself of its contents including the paintings which were auctioned off in a closedbid auction greg autry won the auction and continues to hold the collection which has not been seen for many years'}, {'title': 'Romaine_Brooks', 'label': 'Artist', 'text': 'romaine brooks born beatrice romaine goddard may 1 1874  december 7 1970 was an american painter who worked mostly in paris and capri she specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as cubism and fauvism drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the works of charles conder walter sickert and james mcneill whistler her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats she is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress including her selfportrait of 1923 which is her most widely reproduced work\\nbrooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill by her own account her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life she spent several years in italy and france as a poor art student then inherited a fortune upon her mothers death in 1902 wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects she often painted people close to her such as the italian writer and politician gabriele dannunzio the russian dancer ida rubinstein and her partner of more than 50 years the writer natalie barney\\nalthough she lived until 1970 it is erroneously believed that she painted very little after 1925 despite evidence to the contrary she made a series of drawings during the 1930s using an unpremeditated techniques predating automatic drawing she spent time in new york city in the mid 1930s completing portraits of carl van vechten and muriel draper many of her works are unaccounted for but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork it is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of duke uberto strozzi\\nlife and career\\nearly life and education\\nbeatrice romaine goddard was born in rome the youngest of three children of the wealthy american ella waterman goddard and her husband major henry goddard who was also american her maternal grandfather was the coal mining multimillionaire isaac s waterman jr her parents divorced when she was small and her father abandoned the family beatrice was raised in new york by her unstable mother who abused her emotionally while doting on her mentally ill brother st mar according to one source goddard had to tend to st mar because he attacked anyone else who came near him according to her memoir when she was seven her mother fostered her to a poor family living in a new york city tenement then disappeared and stopped making the agreedupon payments the family continued to care for beatrice although they sank further into poverty she did not tell them where her grandfather lived for fear of being returned to her mother other sources record that she attended a girls school in new jersey an italian convent and a swiss finishing school\\nafter the foster family located her grandfather he arranged to send beatrice to study for several years at st marys hall now doane academy an episcopal girls boarding school in burlington new jersey later she attended a convent school in between times spent with her mother who moved around europe constantly although the stress of travel made st mar harder to control in adulthood goddard brooks referred to herself as having been a childmartyr\\nin 1893 at the age of 19 goddard left her family and went to paris she extracted a meager allowance from her mother took voice lessons and for a time sang in a cabaret before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on february 17 1897 she placed the infant in a convent for care then travelled to rome to study art goddard was the only female student in her life class as it was unusual for women to work from nude models she encountered what now would be called sexual harassment when a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined she picked it up and hit him in the face with it but he and his friends stalked her she fled to capri after he tried to force her to marry him\\nin the summer of 1899 goddard rented a studio in the poorest part of the island of capri despite her best efforts her funds were still insufficient after several months of near starvation she suffered a physical breakdown in 1901 she returned to new york when her brother st mar died with her griefstricken mother dying less than a year later from diabetes complications goddard was 28 when she and her sister inherited the large estate their waterman grandfather had left which made them independently wealthy\\npersonal life\\ndespite being a lesbian on june 13 1903 goddard married her friend john ellingham brooks and acquired british nationality brooks was an unsuccessful pianist and translator who was in deep financial difficulty he was homosexual as well and goddard never revealed exactly why she married him her first biographer meryle secrest suggests that she was motivated by concern for him and a desire for companionship rather than the need for a marriage of convenience they quarreled almost immediately when she cut her hair and ordered mens clothes for a planned walking tour of england he refused to be seen in public with her dressed that way chafing at his desire for outward propriety she left him after only a year and moved to london his repeated references to our money frightened her as the money was her inheritance and none of it his after they split she continued to give brooks an allowance of 300 pounds per year he lived comfortably on capri with ef benson until he died of liver cancer in 1929\\ncareer\\nin 1904 romaine brooks the name she preferred became dissatisfied with her work and in particular with the bright color schemes that she had used in her early paintings she travelled to st ives on the cornish coast rented a small studio and began learning to create finer gradations of gray when a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint from then on nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre umber alizarin and teal by 1905 she had found her tonal palette and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career\\nfirst exhibition\\nbrooks left st ives and moved to paris poor young painters such as pablo picasso and henri matisse were creating new art in the bohemian districts of montparnasse and montmartre in contrast brooks took an apartment in the fashionable 16th arrondissement mingled in elite social circles and painted portraits of wealthy and titled women these included her current lover the princess de polignac\\nin 1910 brooks had her first solo show at the prestigious gallery durandruel displaying thirteen paintings almost all of women or young girls some were portraits others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds often with pensive or withdrawn expressions the paintings were generally naturalistic showing an attentive eye for the details of belle poque fashion with parasols veils and elaborate bonnets on display\\nbrooks included two nude studies in this first exhibitiona provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910 in the red jacket a young woman stands in front of a large folding screen wearing only a small open jacket with her hands behind her back her emaciated stature and forlorn expression led one contemporary reviewer to refer to her as a consumptive brooks described her simply as a poor girl who was cold the other white azaleas is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch contemporary reviews compared it to francisco de goyas la maja desnuda and douard manets olympia unlike the women in those paintings the subject of white azaleas looks away from the viewer in the background above her is a series of japanese prints which brooks loved\\nthe exhibition established brooks reputation as an artist reviews were effusive and the poet robert de montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her the thief of souls the restrained almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention she was often asked to give advice on interior design and sometimes did though she did not relish the role of decorator brooks became increasingly disillusioned with parisian high society finding the conversation dull and feeling that people were whispering about her despite her artistic success she described herself as a lapideliterally a victim of stoning\\ngabriele dannunzio and ida rubinstein\\nin 1909 brooks met gabriele dannunzio an italian writer and politician who had come to france to escape his debts she saw him as a martyred artist another lapid he wrote poems based on her works and called her the most profound and wise orchestrator of grays in modern painting\\nin 1911 brooks became romantically involved with the ukrainianjewish actress and dancer ida rubinstein rubenstein was a tremendous celebrity of her day and caused quite a stir by appearing with serge diaghilevs ballets russes dannunzio had an obsessive but unrequited attraction to rubinstein as well rubinstein was deeply in love with brooks she wanted to buy a farm in the country where they could live togethera mode of life in which brooks had no interest\\nalthough they broke up in 1914 brooks painted rubinstein more often than any other subject for brooks rubinsteins fragile and androgynous beauty represented an aesthetic ideal the earliest of these paintings are a series of allegorical nudes in the crossing also exhibited as the dead woman rubinstein appears to be in a coma stretched out on a white bed or bier against a black void variously interpreted as death or floating in spent sexual satisfaction on brooks symbolic wing in spring she is depicted as a pagan madonna strewing flowers on the ground in a grassy meadow when rubinstein starred in dannunzios play the martyrdom of saint sebastian brooks painted her as a blonde saint sebastiantied to a post being shot with an arrow by a masked dwarf standing on a table the dwarf is a satiric representation of dannunzio\\nat the beginning of world war i brooks painted the cross of france a symbolic image of france at war showing a red cross nurse looking off to the side with a resolute expression while ypres burns in the distance behind her although it is not a portrait of rubinstein it does resemble her and she may have modelled for it it was exhibited along with a poem by dannunzio calling for courage and resolution in wartime and later reproduced in a booklet sold to raise funds for the red cross after the war brooks received the cross of the legion of honor for her fundraising efforts\\nthe political imagery of the cross of france has been compared to eugne delacroixs painting liberty leading the people in which a woman personifying liberty holds up a flag against the background of a burning city delacroixs liberty leads a group of parisians who have taken up arms while the subject of the cross of france stands alone brooks used this romantic image of a figure in heroic isolation in both the 1912 portrait of dannunzio and her 1914 selfportrait the subjects are wrapped in dark cloaks and isolated against seascapes\\nduring the war dannunzio became a national hero as leader of a fighter squadron during the paris peace conference he led a group of nationalist irregulars who seized and held the city of fiume to prevent italy from ceding it to croatia he briefly set up a government the italian regency of carnaro with himself as duce he was never part of benito mussolinis government although he is regarded as a precursor of fascism dannunzio disavowed any connection with mussolini or fascism toward the end of his life\\nthe details of brookss own conservative politics have been clouded by her friendship with dannunzio and admiration of him as an artist and fellow sufferer there is no evidence that she was a cardcarrying fascist or that she was sympathetic to italian fascism the classicizing individualism of her paintings may have been influenced by dannunzios aestheticsan idea that has troubled some viewers otherwise attracted to the imagery of brookss portraits\\non june 16 2016 under the direction of dr langer and legion group arts young italian researcher giovanni rapazzini de buzzaccarini discovered a longlost early work by brooks at the vittoriale in gardone brooks had copied pietro di cristoforo vannucci 14501523 peruginos portrait of a young man at the uffizi when she was a penniless art student in rome she painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl she later gave the painting to dannunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover dannunzio was in the tasteless habitromaine thoughtof hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogues gallery buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room\\ndannunzio and brooks had spent the summer of 1910 in a villa on the coast of france until dannunzio was disrupted by one of his jealous exmistresses she came to the gates of brooks villa with pistol in hand demanding entry after a brief falling out romaine resumed a friendship with dannunzio that lasted until his death in gardone riviera italy\\nbrooks painted rubinstein one last time in the weeping venus 19161917 a nude based on a photographs that brooks took during their relationship she needed them because rubinstein was such a restless and unreliable model according to brooks unpublished memoir the painting represents the passing away of familiar gods as a result of world war i she said she tried to repaint venuss features many times but rubinsteins face somehow kept returning it fixes itself in the mind\\nnatalie barney and left bank portraits\\nthe longest and most important relationship of brooks life was her threeway partnership with natalie clifford barney an americanborn writer and lily de gramont a french aristocrat she formed a trio with them that lasted the rest of their lives\\nbarney was notoriously nonmonogamous a fact that the other two women had to accept brooks met barney in 1916 at a time when the writer had already been involved for about seven years with duchess elisabeth de gramont also known as lily or elisabeth de clermonttonnerre she was married and the mother of two daughters after a brief dustup that resulted in barneys offering gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up brooks the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel gramont one of the most glamorous tastemakers and aristocrats of the period summed up their values when she said civilized beings are those who know how to take more from life than others gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of brooks circle barney hosted a literary salon on pariss left bank\\nbrooks tolerated barneys casual affairs well enough to tease her about them and had a few of her own over the years she could become jealous when a new love became serious usually she simply left town but at one point she gave barney an ultimatum to choose between her and dolly wilderelenting once barney had given in at the same time while brooks was devoted to barney she did not want to live with her fulltime she disliked paris disdained barneys friends and hated the constant socializing on which barney thrived she felt most fully herself when alone to accommodate brookss need for solitude the women built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a diningroom which they called villa trait dunion the hyphenated villa brooks spent part of each year in italy or traveling elsewhere in europe away from barney the relationship lasted for more than 50 years\\nbrookss portrait of barney has a softer look than her other paintings of the 1920s barney sits swathed in a fur coat in the house at 20 rue jacob where she lived and held her salon in the window behind her the courtyard is seen dusted with snow brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters she painted barney with a small sculpture of a horse alluding to the love of riding that had led remy de gourmont to nickname her the amazon the paper on which the horse stands may be one of barneys manuscripts\\nfrom 1920 to 1924 most of brookss subjects were women who were in barneys social circle or who visited her salon truman capote who toured brookss studio in the late 1940s may have been exaggerating when he called it the alltime ultimate gallery of all the famous dykes from 1880 to 1935 or thereabouts but brooks painted many of them barneys lover of the moment was eyre de lanux her own lover renata borgatti una lady troubridge the partner of radclyffe hall and the artist gluck hannah gluckstein another of brooks lovers was the wildly eccentric marchesa luisa casati whose portrait she painted in 1920 while on capri\\nseveral of these paintings depict women who had adopted some elements of male dress while in 1903 brooks had shocked her husband by cutting her hair short and ordering a suit of mens clothes from a tailor by the mid1920s bobbed and cropped hairstyles were in for women and wearing tailored jacketsusually with a skirtwas a recognized fashion discussed in magazines as the severely masculine look women such as gluck troubridge and brooks used variations of the masculine mode not to pass as men but as a signala way of making their sexuality visible to others at the time these paintings were made however it was a code that only a select few knew how to read to a mainstream audience the women in these paintings probably just looked fashionable\\ngluck an english artist whom brooks painted around 1923 was noted in the contemporary press as much for her style of dress as for her art she pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s articles about her presented her crossdressing as an artistic eccentricity or as a sign that she was ultramodern brooks portrait shows gluck in a starched white shirt a silk tie and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a mad dressmaker her right hand at her waist holds a mans hat brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of la belle poque however while many of brooks early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures consumed by petticoats veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity gluck is selfpossessed and quietly intensean artist who insists on being taken seriously her appearance is so androgynous that it would be difficult to identify her as a woman without help from the title and the title itselfpeter a young english girlunderscores the gender ambiguity of the image\\nbrookss 1923 selfportrait has a somber tone brookswho also designed her own clothespainted herself in a tailored riding coat gloves and top hat behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black underneath a slatecolored sky the only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the legion of honor that she wears on her lapel recalling the red cross insignia in the cross of france her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat so that according to one critic shes watching you before you get close enough to look at her shes not passively inviting your approach shes deciding whether youre worth bothering with\\nliterary portraits of brooks\\nin 1925 brooks had solo exhibitions in paris london and new york there is no evidence to substantiate the claim that brooks ceased painting after 1925 while in new york during the 30s she produced portraits of carl van vechten in 1936 muriel draper in 1938 that we know of we know that she purchased paints in wwii when she and natalie were trapped in florence as researchers we know from photographs that there are lost works by brooks still to be rediscovered after that year she produced only four more paintings including portraits of carl van vechten in 1936 and muriel draper in 1938 moreover brooks did complete what previous scholars thought to be her last portrait at the age of 87 in 1961 the artist stated that she had drawn all her life so there is no reason to assume she was not doing so by the time macavoy painted her portrait in fact she herself says in her audio interview from 1968 that she was miffed by the fact that mcavoy portrait of her showed a bunch of dried up brushes rather than the glass table she used as a palette as if i didnt paint her comments seem to indicate she was anything but dried up as a painter in fact she had intended to paint a portrait of macavoy but he never had time to sit for her during the 30s she became the subject of literary portraits by three writers each portrayed her as part of lesbian social circles in paris and capri\\nbrooks was the model for the painter venetia ford in radclyffe halls first novel the forge 1924 the protagonist susan brent first encounters ford among a group of women at a masquerade ball in paris the descriptions of these women correspond closely to brookss portraits particularly those of elisabeth de gramont and una troubridge brent decides to leave her husband and pursue art after seeing the painting the weeping venus brooks also appeared in compton mackenzies extraordinary women 1928 a novel about a group of lesbians on capri during world war i as the composer olympia leigh although the novel is satirical mackenzie treats brooks with more dignity than the rest of the characters portraying her as a detached observer of the others jealous intrigueseven those of which she is the focus in djuna barness ladies almanack 1928 a roman  clef of natalie barneys circle in paris she makes a brief appearance as cynic sal who dresses like a coachman of the period of pecksniffa reference to the style of dress seen in her 1923 selfportrait\\ndrawings and later life\\nin 1930 while laid up with a sprained leg brooks began a series of more than 100 drawings of humans angels demons animals and monsters all formed out of continuous curved lines she said that when she started a line she did not know where it would go and that the drawings evolve\\xa0d from the subconsciouswithout premeditation brooks was writing her unpublished memoir no pleasant memories at the same time she began this series of drawings critics have interpreted them as exploring the continuing effect of her childhood on hera theme expressed even in the symbol she used to sign them a wing on a spring decades later at 85 she said my dead mother gets between me and life\\nbrooks is thought to have stopped painting by several writers but she herself tells us that she drew all her life she moved from paris to villa santagnese a villa outside florence italy in 1937 and in 1940fleeing the invasion of france by germanybarney joined her there after world war ii ended brooks declined to move back to paris with barney saying she wanted to get back to her painting and painters life but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war she and barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings she became increasingly reclusive and while barney continued to visit her frequently by the mid1950s she had to stay in a hotel meeting brooks only for lunch brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room believing she was losing her eyesight according to secrest she became paranoid fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her however subsequent research langer leads researchers to believe her fears were not unfounded in a 1965 letter she cautioned barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden lest the plants feed on her life force trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry in the last year of her life she stopped communicating with barney entirely leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when barney came to visit her reasons for doing so are referenced in langers biography she died in nice france in 1970 at the age of 96 brooks is buried in the old english cemetery in nice in a family plot with her mother and her brother st mar\\ninfluences\\nbrooks kept aloof from the artistic trends and movements of her time acting as if the fauvists the cubists and the abstract expressionists did not exist however some critics have mistakenly said brooks was influenced by aubrey beardsleys illustrations a claim brooks herself refutes in her 1968 audio interview the imagery of the 1930s drawings continues brookss experiments in the surreal that she began as a teenager in the late 1880s her use of premeditated drawings as a route to the subconscious has been compared to automatic drawings by the surrealists of the 1920s but brookss work predates surrealists such as andr masson by decades macavoy called her the first surrealist\\nthe most widely observed influence on brookss painting is that of james mcneill whistler whose subdued palette probably inspired her to adopt a monotone color scheme with accents of tinted pigments because through this technique she could suggest a classical restraint and create tensions that were modulated by shape texture and variations of shading throughout her canvases she may have been introduced to whistlers work by the art collector charles lang freer whom she met on capri around 1899 and who bought one of her early works brooks said she wondered at the magic subtlety of whistlers tones but thought his symphonies lacked the corresponding subtlety of expression one 1920 portrait may take its composition from a painting by whistler while the poses are almost identical brooks removes the little girl and all the details of whistlers domestic scene leaving only borgatti and her pianoan image of an artist completely focused on her art\\nlegacy and modern criticism\\nbrookss realistic style may have led many art critics to dismiss her and by the 1960s her work was largely forgotten the revival of figurative painting since the 1980s and new interest in the exploration of gender and sexuality through art have led to a reassessment of her work she is now seen as a precursor of presentday artists whose works depict gender variance and transgender themes critics have described her portraits of the 1920s as a sly

romaine brooks declaring the world is finally ready to understand romaine brooks'}, {'title': 'Staphylococcus_aureus', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'staphylococcus aureus is a grampositive roundshaped bacterium a member of the firmicutes and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin it is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen although s aureus usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses respiratory infections such as sinusitis and food poisoning pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins and the expression of a cellsurface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies s aureus is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibioticresistant strains such as methicillinresistant s aureus mrsa is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine despite much research and development no vaccine for s aureus has been approved\\nan estimated 20 to 30 of the human population are longterm carriers of s aureus which can be found as part of the normal skin flora in the nostrils and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of women s aureus can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections such as pimples impetigo boils cellulitis folliculitis carbuncles scalded skin syndrome and abscesses to lifethreatening diseases such as pneumonia meningitis osteomyelitis endocarditis toxic shock syndrome bacteremia and sepsis it is still one of the five most common causes of hospitalacquired infections and is often the cause of wound infections following surgery each year around 500000 patients in hospitals of the united states contract a staphylococcal infection chiefly by s aureus up to 50000 deaths each year in the united states are linked with s aureus infections\\nhistory\\ndiscovery\\nin 1880 alexander ogston a scottish surgeon discovered that staphylococcus can cause wound infections after noticing groups of bacteria in pus from a surgical abscess during a procedure he was performing he named it staphylococcus after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope then in 1884 german scientist friedrich julius rosenbach identified staphylococcus aureus discriminating and separating it from staphylococcus albus a related bacterium in the early 1930s doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an s aureus infection by the means of coagulase testing which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium prior to the 1940s s aureus infections were fatal in the majority of patients however doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure s aureus infections unfortunately by the end of the 1940s penicillin resistance became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur\\nevolution\\nstaphylococcus aureus can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages there are numerous minor lineages as well but these are not seen in the population as often genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved with the exception of mobile genetic elements mobile genetic elements that are common in s aureus include bacteriophages pathogenicity islands plasmids transposons and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes these elements have enabled s aureus to continually evolve and gain new traits there is a great deal of genetic variation within the s aureus species a study by fitzgerald et al 2001 revealed that approximately 22 of the s aureus genome is noncoding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium an example of this difference is seen in the species virulence only a few strains of s aureus are associated with infections in humans this demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species\\nit has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections this occurs when multiple different types of s aureus cause an infection within a host the different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group increasing its pathogenic ability thus there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements\\nanother notable evolutionary process within the s aureus species is its coevolution with its human hosts over time this parasitic relationship has led to the bacteriums ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection this allows it to be passed throughout the human population increasing its fitness as a species however only approximately 50 of the human population are carriers of s aureus with 20 as continuous carriers and 30 as intermittent this leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether s aureus is carried asymptomatically in humans including factors that are specific to an individual person according to a 1995 study by hofman et al these factors may include age sex diabetes and smoking they also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for s aureus to colonize notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger corticosteroid production in conclusion there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive as this is highly dependent upon human factors\\nthough s aureus has quick reproductive and microevolutionary rates there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species one such barrier is agr which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria this such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it thus s aureus must make a tradeoff to increase their success as a species exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance another barrier to evolution is the sau1 type i restriction modification rm system this system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign dna by digesting it exchange of dna between the same lineage is not blocked since they have the same enzymes and the rm system does not recognize the new dna as foreign but transfer between different lineages is blocked\\nmicrobiology\\ns aureus  greek  grapecluster berry latin aureus golden is a facultative aerobic grampositive coccal round bacterium also known as golden staph and oro staphira s aureus is nonmotile and does not form spores in medical literature the bacterium is often referred to as s aureus staph aureus or staph a s aureus appears as staphylococci grapelike clusters when viewed through a microscope and has large round goldenyellow colonies often with hemolysis when grown on blood agar plates s aureus reproduces asexually by binary fission complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by s aureus autolysin and in its absence or targeted inhibition the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters\\ns aureus is catalasepositive meaning it can produce the enzyme catalase catalase converts hydrogen peroxide  to water and oxygen catalaseactivity tests are sometimes used to distinguish staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci previously s aureus was differentiated from other staphylococci by the coagulase test however not all s aureus strains are coagulasepositive and incorrect species identification can impact effective treatment and control measures\\nstaphylococcus is different from the similarly named and medically relevant genus streptococcus\\nnatural genetic transformation is a reproductive process involving dna transfer from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination s aureus was found to be capable of natural genetic transformation but only at low frequency under the experimental conditions employed further studies suggested that the development of competence for natural genetic transformation may be substantially higher under appropriate conditions yet to be discovered\\nrole in health\\nin humans s aureus can be present in the upper respiratory tract gut mucosa and skin as a member of the normal microbiota however because s aureus can cause disease under certain host and environmental conditions it is characterized as a pathobiont\\nrole in disease\\nwhile s aureus usually acts as a commensal bacterium asymptomatically colonizing about 30 of the human population it can sometimes cause disease in particular s aureus is one of the most common causes of bacteremia and infective endocarditis additionally it can cause various skin and softtissue infections particularly when skin or mucosal barriers have been breached\\ns aureus infections can spread through contact with pus from an infected wound skintoskin contact with an infected person and contact with objects used by an infected person such as towels sheets clothing or athletic equipment joint replacements put a person at particular risk of septic arthritis staphylococcal endocarditis infection of the heart valves and pneumonia\\npreventive measures include washing hands often with soap and making sure to bathe or shower daily\\ns aureus is a significant cause of chronic biofilm infections on medical implants and the repressor of toxins is part of the infection pathway\\ns aureus can lay dormant in the body for years undetected once symptoms begin to show the host is contagious for another two weeks and the overall illness lasts a few weeks if untreated though the disease can be deadly deeply penetrating s aureus infections can be severe\\nskin infections\\nskin infections are the most common form of s aureus infection this can manifest in various ways including small benign boils folliculitis impetigo cellulitis and more severe invasive softtissue infections\\ns aureus is extremely prevalent in persons with atopic dermatitis more commonly known as eczema it is mostly found in fertile active places including the armpits hair and scalp large pimples that appear in those areas may exacerbate the infection if lacerated this can lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome a severe form of which can be seen in newborns\\nthe presence of s aureus in persons with atopic dermatitis is not an indication to treat with oral antibiotics as evidence has not shown this to give benefit to the patient however topical antibiotics combined with corticosteroids have been found to improve the condition colonization of s aureus drives inflammation of atopic dermatitis s aureus is believed to exploit defects in the skin barrier of persons with atopic dermatitis triggering cytokine expression and therefore exacerbating symptoms\\nfood poisoning\\ns aureus is also responsible for food poisoning and achieves this by generating toxins in the human body its incubation period lasts one to six hours with the illness itself lasting from 30 minutes to 3 days\\npreventive measures one can take to help prevent the spread of the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food stay away from any food if ill and wear gloves if any open wounds occur on hands or wrists while preparing food if storing food for longer than 2 hours keep the food below 40 or above 140 f 44 or 60\\xa0c\\nbone and joint infections\\ns aureus is the bacterium commonly responsible for all major bone and joint infections this manifests in one of three forms osteomyelitis septic arthritis and infection from a replacement joint surgery\\nbacteremia\\ns aureus is a leading cause of bloodstream infections throughout much of the industrialized world infection is generally associated with breaks in the skin or mucosal membranes due to surgery injury or use of intravascular devices such as catheters hemodialysis machines or injected drugs once the bacteria have entered the bloodstream they can infect various organs causing infective endocarditis septic arthritis and osteomyelitis this disease is particularly prevalent and severe in the very young and very old\\nwithout antibiotic treatment s aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate around 80 with antibiotic treatment case fatality rates range from 15 to 50 depending on the age and health of the patient as well as the antibiotic resistance of the s aureus strain\\nmedical implant infections\\ns aureus is often found in biofilms formed on medical devices implanted in the body or on human tissue it is commonly found with another pathogen candida albicans forming multispecies biofilms the latter is suspected to help s aureus penetrate human tissue a higher mortality is linked with multispecies biofilms\\ns aureus biofilm is the predominant cause of orthopedic implantrelated infections but is also found on cardiac implants vascular grafts various catheters and cosmetic surgical implants after implantation the surface of these devices becomes coated with host proteins which provide a rich surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation once the device becomes infected it must by completely removed since s aureus biofilm cannot be destroyed by antibiotic treatments\\ncurrent therapy for s aureus biofilmmediated infections involves surgical removal of the infected device followed by antibiotic treatment conventional antibiotic treatment alone is not effective in eradicating such infections an alternative to postsurgical antibiotic treatment is using antibioticloaded dissolvable calcium sulfate beads which are implanted with the medical device these beads can release high doses of antibiotics at the desired site to prevent the initial infection\\nnovel treatments for s aureus biofilm involving nano silver particles bacteriophages and plantderived antibiotic agents are being studied these agents have shown inhibitory effects against s aureus embedded in biofilms a class of enzymes have been found to have biofilm matrixdegrading ability thus may be used as biofilm dispersal agents in combination with antibiotics\\nanimal infections\\ns aureus can survive on dogs cats and horses and can cause bumblefoot in chickens some believe healthcare workers dogs should be considered a significant source of antibioticresistant s aureus especially in times of outbreak in a 2008 study by boost odonoghue and james it was found that just about 90 of s aureus colonized within pet dogs presented as resistant to at least one antibiotic the nasal region has been implicated as the most important site of transfer between dogs and humans\\ns aureus is one of the causal agents of mastitis in dairy cows its large polysaccharide capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cows immune defenses\\nvirulence factors\\nenzymes\\ns aureus produces various enzymes such as coagulase bound and free coagulases which clots plasma and coats the bacterial cell probably to prevent phagocytosis\\nhyaluronidase also known as spreading factor breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it deoxyribonuclease which breaks down the dna protects s aureus from neutrophil extracellular trapmediated killing s aureus also produces lipase to digest lipids staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread and betalactamase for drug resistance\\ntoxins\\ndepending on the strain s aureus is capable of secreting several exotoxins which can be categorized into three groups many of these toxins are associated with specific diseases\\nantigens known as superantigens can induce toxic shock syndrome tss this group comprises 25 staphylococcal enterotoxins ses which have been identified to date and named alphabetically sea  sez including enterotoxin type b as well as the toxic shock syndrome toxin tsst1 which causes tss associated with tampon use toxic shock syndrome is characterized by fever erythematous rash low blood pressure shock multiple organ failure and skin peeling lack of antibody to tsst1 plays a part in the pathogenesis of tss other strains of s aureus can produce an enterotoxin that is the causative agent of a type of gastroenteritis this form of gastroenteritis is selflimiting characterized by vomiting and diarrhea 16 hours after ingestion of the toxin with recovery in 8 to 24 hours symptoms include nausea vomiting diarrhea and major abdominal pain\\n exfoliative toxins are exotoxins implicated in the disease staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome ssss which occurs most commonly in infants and young children it also may occur as epidemics in hospital nurseries the protease activity of the exfoliative toxins causes peeling of the skin observed with ssss\\n staphylococcal toxins that act on cell membranes include alpha toxin beta toxin delta toxin and several bicomponent toxins strains of s aureus can host phages such as the prophage pvl that produces pantonvalentine leukocidin pvl to increase virulence the bicomponent toxin pvl is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia in children the genes encoding the components of pvl are encoded on a bacteriophage found in communityassociated mrsa strains\\nsmall rna\\nthe list of small rnas involved in the control of bacterial virulence in s aureus is growing this can be facilitated by factors such as increased biofilm formation in the presence of increased levels of such small rnas for example rnaiii sprd sprc rsae spra1 ssr42 artr sprx and teg49\\nstrategies for posttranscriptional regulation by 3untranslated region\\nmany mrnas in s aureus carry three prime untranslated regions 3utr longer than 100 nucleotides which may potentially have a regulatory function\\nfurther investigation of icar mrna mrna coding for the repressor of the main expolysaccharidic compound of the bacteria biofilm matrix demonstrated that the 3utr binding to the 5 utr can interfere with the translation initiation complex and generate a double stranded substrate for rnase iii the interaction is between the uccccug motif in the 3utr and the shinedalagarno region at the 5utr deletion of the motif resulted in icar repressor accumulation and inhibition of biofilm development the biofilm formation is the main cause of staphylococcus implant infections\\nbiofilm\\nbiofilms are groups of microorganisms such as bacteria that attach to each other and grow on wet surfaces the s aureus biofilm is embedded in a glycocalyx slime layer and can consist of teichoic acids host proteins extracellular dna edna and polysaccharide intercellular antigen pia not all s aureus biofilms contain pia s aureus biofilms are important in disease pathogenesis as they can contribute to antibiotic resistance and immune system evasion s aureus biofilm has high resistance to antibiotic treatments and host immune response one hypothesis for explaining this is that the biofilm matrix protects the embedded cells by acting as a barrier to prevent antibiotic penetration however the biofilm matrix is composed with many water channels so this hypothesis is becoming increasingly less likely but a biofilm matrix possibly contains antibioticdegrading enzymes such as lactamases which can prevent antibiotic penetration another hypothesis is that the conditions in the biofilm matrix favor the formation of persister cells which are highly antibioticresistant dormant bacterial cells s aureus biofilms also have high resistance to host immune response though the exact mechanism of resistance is unknown s aureus biofilms have increased growth under the presence of cytokines produced by the host immune response host antibodies are less effective for s aureus biofilm due to the heterogeneous antigen distribution where an antigen may be present in some areas of the biofilm but completely absent from other areas\\nstudies in biofilm development have shown to be related to changes in gene expression there are specific genes that were found to be crucial in the different biofilm growth stages two of these genes include rocd and gudb which encode for the enzymes ornithineoxoacid transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase which are important for amino acid metabolism studies have shown biofilm development rely on amino acids glutamine and glutamate for proper metabolic functions\\nother immunoevasive strategies\\nprotein a is anchored to staphylococcal peptidoglycan pentaglycine bridges chains of five glycine residues by the transpeptidase sortase a protein a an iggbinding protein binds to the fc region of an antibody in fact studies involving mutation of genes coding for protein a resulted in a lowered virulence of s aureus as measured by survival in blood which has led to speculation that protein acontributed virulence requires binding of antibody fc regions\\nprotein a in various recombinant forms has been used for decades to bind and purify a wide range of antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography transpeptidases such as the sortases responsible for anchoring factors like protein a to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan are being studied in hopes of developing new antibiotics to target mrsa infections\\nsome strains of s aureus are capable of producing staphyloxanthin  a goldencoloured carotenoid pigment this pigment acts as a virulence factor primarily by being a bacterial antioxidant which helps the microbe evade the reactive oxygen species which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens\\nmutant strains of s aureus modified to lack staphyloxanthin are less likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical such as hydrogen peroxide than pigmented strains mutant colonies are quickly killed when exposed to human neutrophils while many of the pigmented colonies survive in mice the pigmented strains cause lingering abscesses when inoculated into wounds whereas wounds infected with the unpigmented strains quickly heal\\nthese tests suggest the staphylococcus strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system drugs designed to inhibit the production of staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics in fact because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol a drug developed in the context of cholesterollowering therapy was shown to block s aureus pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model\\nclassical diagnosis\\ndepending upon the type of infection present an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly and sent to the laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzymebased tests a gram stain is first performed to guide the way which should show typical grampositive bacteria cocci in clusters second the isolate is cultured on mannitol salt agar which is a selective medium with 75 nacl that allows s aureus to grow producing yellowcolored colonies as a result of mannitol fermentation and subsequent drop in the mediums ph\\nfurthermore for differentiation on the species level catalase positive for all staphylococcus species coagulase fibrin clot formation positive for s aureus dnase zone of clearance on dnase agar lipase a yellow color and rancid odor smell and phosphatase a pink color tests are all done for staphylococcal food poisoning phage typing can be performed to determine whether the staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection\\nrapid diagnosis and typing\\nrecent activities and food that a patient has recently eaten will be inquired about by a physician and a physical examination is conducted to review any symptoms with more severe symptoms blood tests and stool culture may be in order\\ndiagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks and new strains of s aureus recent genetic advances have enabled reliable and rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of clinical isolates of s aureus in real time these tools support infection control strategies to limit bacterial spread and ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics quantitative pcr is increasingly being used to identify outbreaks of infection\\nwhen observing the evolvement of s aureus and its ability to adapt to each modified antibiotic two basic methods known as bandbased or sequencebased are employed keeping these two methods in mind other methods such as multilocus sequence typing mlst pulsedfield gel electrophoresis pfge bacteriophage typing spa locus typing and sccmec typing are often conducted more than others with these methods it can be determined where strains of mrsa originated and also where they are currently \\nwith mlst this technique of typing uses fragments of several housekeeping genes known as aroe glpf gmk pta tip and yqil these sequences are then assigned a number which give to a string of several numbers that serve as the allelic profile although this is a common method a limitation about this method is the maintenance of the microarray which detects newly allelic profiles making it a costly and timeconsuming experiment\\nwith pfge a method which is still very much used dating back to its first success in 1980s remains capable of helping differentiate mrsa isolates to accomplish this the technique uses multiple gel electrophoresis along with a voltage gradient to display clear resolutions of molecules the s aureus fragments then transition down the gel producing specific band patterns that are later compared with other isolates in hopes of identifying related strains limitations of the method include practical difficulties with uniform band patterns and pfge sensitivity as a whole\\nspa locus typing is also considered a popular technique that uses a single locus zone in a polymorphic region of s aureus to distinguish any form of mutations although this technique is often inexpensive and less timeconsuming the chance of losing discriminatory power making it hard to differentiate between mlst clonal complexes exemplifies a crucial limitation\\ntreatment\\nfor susceptible strains the treatment of choice for s aureus infection is penicillin an antibiotic derived from some penicillium fungal species penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan crosslinkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall the fourmembered lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme ddtranspeptidase an enzyme that when functional crosslinks chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls the binding of lactam to ddtranspeptidase inhibits the enzymes functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the crosslinks as a result cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced thus resulting in cell death in most countries however penicillin resistance is extremely common gt90 and firstline therapy is most commonly a penicillinaseresistant lactam antibiotic for example oxacillin or flucloxacillin both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin or vancomycin depending on local resistance patterns combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections such as endocarditis but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys the duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity adjunctive rifampicin has been historically used in the management of s aureus bacteraemia but randomised controlled trial evidence has shown this to be of no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy\\nantibiotic resistance in s aureus was uncommon when penicillin was first introduced in 1943 indeed the original petri dish on which alexander fleming of imperial college london observed the antibacterial activity of the penicillium fungus was growing a culture of s aureus by 1950 40 of hospital s aureus isolates were penicillinresistant by 1960 this had risen to 80\\nmethicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa often pronounced or  is one of a number of greatly feared strains of s aureus which have become resistant to most lactam antibiotics for this reason vancomycin a glycopeptide antibiotic is commonly used to combat mrsa vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan but unlike lactam antibiotics glycopeptide antibiotics target and bind to amino acids in the cell wall preventing peptidoglycan crosslinkages from forming mrsa strains are most often found associated with institutions such as hospitals but are becoming increasingly prevalent in communityacquired infections\\nminor skin infections can be treated with triple antibiotic ointment one topical agent that is prescribed is mupirocin a protein synthesis inhibitor that is produced naturally by pseudomonas fluorescens and has seen success for treatment of s aureus nasal carriage\\nantibiotic resistance\\ns aureus was found to be the second leading pathogen for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019\\nstaphylococcal resistance to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase a form of betalactamase production an enzyme that cleaves the lactam ring of the penicillin molecule rendering the antibiotic ineffective penicillinaseresistant lactam antibiotics such as methicillin nafcillin oxacillin cloxacillin dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase\\nresistance to methicillin is mediated via the mec operon part of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec sccmec sccmec is a family of mobile genetic elements which is a major driving force of s aureus evolution resistance is conferred by the meca gene which codes for an altered penicillinbinding protein pbp2a or pbp2 that has a lower affinity for binding lactams penicillins cephalosporins and carbapenems this allows for resistance to all lactam antibiotics and obviates their clinical use during mrsa infections studies have explained that this mobile genetic element has been acquired by different lineages in separate gene transfer events indicating that there is not a common ancestor of differing mrsa strains interestingly one study suggests that mrsa sacrifices virulence for example toxin production and invasiveness for survival and creation of biofilms\\naminoglycoside antibiotics such as kanamycin gentamicin streptomycin were once effective against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides action which occurs via protonated amine andor hydroxyl interactions with the ribosomal rna of the bacterial 30s ribosomal subunit three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted aminoglycoside modifying enzymes ribosomal mutations and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria\\naminoglycosidemodifying enzymes inactivate the aminoglycoside by covalently attaching either a phosphate nucleotide or acetyl moiety to either the amine or the alcohol key functional group or both groups of the antibiotic this changes the charge or sterically hinders the antibiotic decreasing its ribosomal binding affinity in s aureus the bestcharacterized aminoglycosidemodifying enzyme is aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase 4 ia ant4ia this enzyme has been solved by xray crystallography the enzyme is able to attach an adenyl moiety to the 4 hydroxyl group of many aminoglycosides including kamamycin and gentamicin\\nglycopeptide resistance is mediated by acquisition of the vana gene which originates from the tn1546 transposon found in a plasmid in enterococci and codes for an enzyme that produces an alternative peptidoglycan to which vancomycin will not bind\\ntoday s aureus has become resistant to many commonly used antibiotics in the uk only 2 of all s aureus isolates are sensitive to penicillin with a similar picture in the rest of the world the lactamaseresistant penicillins methicillin oxacillin cloxacillin and flucloxacillin were developed to treat penicillinresistant s aureus and are still used as firstline treatment methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used it was introduced in 1959 but only two years later the first case of methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa was reported in england\\ndespite this mrsa generally remained an uncommon finding even in hospital settings until the 1990s when the mrsa prevalence in hospitals exploded and it is now endemic now methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa is not only a human pathogen causing a variety of infections such as skin and soft tissue infection ssti pneumonia and sepsis but it also can cause disease in animals known as livestockassociated mrsa lamrsa\\nmrsa infections in both the hospital and community setting are commonly treated with nonlactam antibiotics such as clindamycin a lincosamine and cotrimoxazole also commonly known as trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole resistance to these antibiotics has also led to the use of new broadspectrum antigrampositive antibiotics such as linezolid because of its availability as an oral drug firstline treatment for serious invasive infections due to mrsa is currently glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin a number of problems with these antibiotics occur such as the need for intravenous administration no oral preparation is available toxicity and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests also glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillinsensitive s aureus mssa as outcomes are inferior\\nbecause of the high level of resistance to penicillins and because of the potential for mrsa to develop resistance to vancomycin the us centers for disease control and prevention has published guidelines for the appropriate use of vancomycin in situations where the incidence of mrsa infections is known to be high the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide antibiotic until the identity of the infecting organism is known after the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillinsusceptible strain of s aureus treatment can be changed to flucloxacillin or even penicillin as appropriate\\nvancomycinresistant s aureus vrsa is a strain of s aureus that has become resistant to the glycopeptides the first case of vancomycinintermediate s aureus visa was reported in japan in 1996 but the first case of s aureus truly resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics was only reported in 2002 three cases of vrsa infection had been reported in the united states as of 2005 at least in part the antimicrobial resistance in s aureus can be explained by its ability to adapt multiple two component signal transduction pathways helps s aureus to express genes that are required to survive under antimicrobial stress\\ncarriage\\nabout 33 of the us population are carriers of s aureus and about 2 carry mrsa even healthcare providers can be mrsa colonizers\\nthe carriage of s aureus is an important source of hospitalacquired infection also called nosocomial and communityacquired mrsa although s aureus can be present on the skin of the host a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears the ability of the nasal passages to harbour s aureus results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacteriums ability to evade host innate immunity nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections\\ninfection control\\nspread of s aureus including mrsa generally is through humantohuman contact although recently some veterinarians have discovered the infection can be spread through pets with environmental contamination thought to play a relatively less important part emphasis on basic hand washing techniques are therefore effective in preventing its transmission the use of disposable aprons and gloves by staff reduces skintoskin contact so further reduces the risk of transmission\\nrecently myriad cases of s aureus have been reported in hospitals across america transmission of the pathogen is facilitated in medical settings where healthcare worker hygiene is insufficient s aureus is an incredibly hardy bacterium as was shown in a study where it survived on polyester for just under three months polyester is the main material used in hospital privacy curtains\\nthe bacteria are transported on the hands of healthcare workers who may pick them up from a seemingly healthy patient carrying a benign or commensal strain of s aureus and then pass it on to the next patient being treated introduction of the bacteria into the bloodstream can lead to various complications including endocarditis meningitis and if it is widespread sepsis\\nethanol has proven to be an effective topical sanitizer against mrsa quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning nonflammable alcohol vapor in navco2 systems have an advantage as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance\\nan important and previously unrecognized means of communityassociated mrsa colonization and transmission is during sexual contact\\ns aureus is killed in one minute at 78\\xa0c and in ten minutes at 64\\xa0c but is resistant to freezing\\ncertain strains of s aureus have been described as being resistant to chlorine disinfection\\nthe use of mupirocin ointment can reduce the rate of infections due to nasal carriage of s aureus there is limited evidence that nasal decontamination of s aureus using antibiotics or antiseptics can reduce the rates of surgical site infections\\nresearch\\nas of 2021 no approved vaccine exists against s aureus early clinical trials have been conducted for several vaccines candidates such as nabis staphvax and pentastaph intercells  mercks v710 vris sa75 and others\\nwhile some of these vaccines candidates have shown immune responses others aggravated an infection by s aureus to date none of these candidates provides protection against a s aureus infection the development of nabis staphvax was stopped in 2005 after phase iii trials failed intercells first v710 vaccine variant was terminated during phase iiiii after higher mortality and morbidity were observed among patients who developed s aureus infection\\nnabis enhanced s

as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children although these issues do occasionally persist into adulthood rad is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts it can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate wayknown as the inhibited form in the dsm5 the disinhibited form is considered a separate diagnosis named disinhibited attachment disorder\\nrad arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect abuse abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years frequent changes of caregivers or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a childs communicative efforts not all or even a majority of such experiences result in the disorder it is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability all of which can affect attachment behavior the criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment disorder are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment\\nchildren with rad are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life there are few studies of longterm effects and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years however the opening of orphanages in eastern europe following the end of the cold war in the early 1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence causes mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late 1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications\\nmainstream treatment and prevention programs that target rad and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver or if that is not possible placing the child with a different caregiver most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless attachment disorder within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as attachment therapy attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different from criteria under icd10 or dsmivtr or to attachment behaviors a range of treatment approaches are used in attachment therapy some of which are physically and psychologically coercive and considered to be antithetical to attachment theory\\nsigns and symptoms\\npediatricians are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of rad in children with the disorder the initial presentation varies according to the childs developmental and chronological age although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction infants up to about 1824 months may present with nonorganic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated\\nthe core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children this can manifest itself in three ways\\nwhile rad occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect however the instances of that ability are rare\\nthe name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria include symptoms such as failure to thrive a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness apathy and onset before 8 months\\nassessment tools\\nthere is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis recognized assessment methods of attachment styles difficulties or disorders include the strange situation procedure devised by developmental psychologist mary ainsworth the separation and reunion procedure and the preschool assessment of attachment the observational record of the caregiving environment the attachment qsort and a variety of narrative techniques using stem stories puppets or pictures for older children actual interviews such as the child attachment interview and the autobiographical emotional events dialogue can be used caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the working model of the child interview\\nmore recent research also uses the disturbances of attachment interview dai developed by smyke and zeanah 1999 the dai is a semistructured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers it covers 12 items namely having a discriminated preferred adult seeking comfort when distressed responding to comfort when offered social and emotional reciprocity emotional regulation checking back after venturing away from the care giver reticence with unfamiliar adults willingness to go off with relative strangers selfendangering behavior excessive clinging vigilancehypercompliance and role reversal this method is designed to pick up not only rad but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment\\ncauses\\nalthough increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to genetic defects reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder it has been suggested that types of temperament or constitutional response to the environment may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years in the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders\\nwhile similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder inhibited and disinhibited studies show that abuse and neglect were far more prominent and severe in the cases of rad disinhibited type the issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved rad has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same\\nin discussing the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a sevenyear twin study it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology including rad borderline personality disorder bpd and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd can be found in disturbances in affect regulation the subsequent development of higherorder selfregulation is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected consequently the templates in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted the potential for reregulation modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range in the presence of corrective experiences normative caregiving seems possible\\ndiagnosis\\nrad is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the dsm there is little systematic epidemiologic information on rad its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment\\naccording to the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry aacap children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan the signs or symptoms of rad may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and aacap advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history as available of the childs patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers it also requires observations of the childs behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the childs early caregiving environment including for example pediatricians teachers or caseworkers in the us initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists psychiatrists licensed marriage and family therapists licensed professional counselors specialist licensed clinical social workers or psychiatric nurses\\nin the uk the british association for adoption and fostering baaf advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the childs individual and family history\\naccording to the aacap practice parameter 2005 the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of rad change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult there are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence assessments of rad past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior\\ncriteria\\nicd10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood known as rad and disinhibited attachment disorder less well known as dad dsmivtr also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes inhibited type and disinhibited type both known as rad the two classifications are similar and both include\\nicd10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect abuse or serious mishandling dsm states in relation to both forms there must be a history of pathogenic care defined as persistent disregard of the childs basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder for this reason part of the diagnosis is the childs history of care rather than observation of symptoms\\nin dsmivtr the inhibited form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions as manifest by excessively inhibited hypervigilant or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses eg the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach avoidance and resistance to comforting or may exhibit frozen watchfulness hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat alarm or distress thus failing to maintain proximity an essential element of attachment behavior the disinhibited form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments eg excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures there is therefore a lack of specificity of attachment figure the second basic element of attachment behavior\\nthe icd10 descriptions are comparable save that icd10 includes in its description several elements not included in dsmivtr as follows\\nthe first of these is somewhat controversial being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder\\nthe inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver while the disinhibited form is more enduring icd10 states the disinhibited form tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child the question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised the world health organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision one reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment\\n the american psychiatric association has proposed to redefine rad into two distinct disorders in the dsmv corresponding with the inhibited type one disorder will be reclassified as reactive attachment disorder of infancy and early childhood\\nin regards to pathogenic care or the type of care in which these behaviors are present a new criterion for disinhibited social engagement disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high childcaregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver\\ndifferential diagnosis\\nthe diagnostic complexities of rad mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential several other disorders such as conduct disorders oppositional defiant disorder anxiety disorders post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with rad leading to over and under diagnosis rad can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism pervasive developmental disorder childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability they are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home\\nalternative diagnosis\\nin the absence of a standardized diagnosis system many popular informal classification systems or checklists outside the dsm and icd were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy these lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons many are found on the websites of attachment therapists common elements of these lists such as lying lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either dsmivtr or icd10 many children are being diagnosed with rad because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria there is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders however knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders\\nthe randolph attachment disorder questionnaire or radq is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others the checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours many of which either overlap with other disorders like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder or are not related to attachment difficulties critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity\\ntreatment\\nassessing the childs safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit including financial or domestic aid housing and social work support psychotherapeutic interventions including treating parents for mental illness family therapy individual therapy education including training in basic parenting skills and child development and monitoring of the childs safety within the family environment\\nin 2005 the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry laid down guidelines devised by nw boris and ch zeanah based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of rad recommendations in the guidelines include the following\\nmainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver or if that is not possible placing the child with a different caregiver these approaches are mostly in the process of being evaluated the programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a twoway process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses approaches include watch wait and wonder manipulation of sensitive responsiveness modified interaction guidance clinicianassisted videofeedback exposure sessions caves preschool parent psychotherapy circle of security attachment and biobehavioral catchup abc the new orleans intervention and parentchild psychotherapy other treatment methods include developmental individualdifference and relationshipbased therapy dir also referred to as floor time by stanley greenspan although dir is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders\\nthe relevance of these approaches to intervention with fostered and adopted children with rad or older children with significant histories of maltreatment is unclear\\nattachment therapy\\nthe terms attachment disorder attachment problems and attachment therapy although increasingly used have no clear specific or consensus definitions however the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated particularly those in the foster care kinship care or adoption systems and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages\\noutside the mainstream programs is a form of treatment generally known as attachment therapy a subset of techniques and accompanying novel diagnosis for supposed attachment disorders including rad these attachment disorders use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different from criteria under icd10 or dsmivtr or to attachment behaviors sufferers of attachment disorder are said to lack empathy and remorse\\ntreatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called attachment therapy in general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers the theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control there is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream there is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from noncoercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical confrontational and coercive techniques of which the best known are holding therapy rebirthing ragereduction and the evergreen model these forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage aversive tickling enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm are potentially abusive and are antithetical to attachment theory the apsac taskforce report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver children may be described as rads radkids or radishes and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy the mayo clinic a well known us nonprofit medical practice and medical research group cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques to date this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals\\nprognosis\\nthe aacap guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others however the course of rad is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time the few existing longitudinal studies dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time involve only children from poorly run eastern european institutions\\nfindings from the studies of children from eastern european orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of rad is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative caregiving environments however there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors the quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent caregivers may be compromised but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited rad the same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided indiscriminate sociability may persist for years even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships in the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence these children were significantly more likely to exhibit poor peer relationships\\nstudies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive no matter what quality of care they received in one investigation some institutionreared boys were reported to be inattentive overactive and markedly unselective in their social relationships while girls fosterreared children and some institutionreared children were not it is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment\\nthere is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a followup in 2006 this study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements the paper explores the similarities differences and comorbidity of rad disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder the girl showed signs of the inhibited form of rad while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form it was noted that the diagnosis of rad ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes at age three some lasting relationship disturbance was evident\\nin the followup case study when the twins were aged three and eight years the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted the girls symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviorsa welldocumented outcome the boy still exhibited selfendangering behaviors not within rad criteria but possibly within secure base distortion where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment at age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems or the childs internal working models the twins symptoms were indicative of different trajectories the girl showed externalizing symptoms particularly deceit contradictory reports of current functioning chaotic personal narratives struggles with friendships and emotional disengagement with her caregiver resulting in a clinical picture described as quite concerning the boy still evidenced selfendangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties it was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently the narrative measures used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships\\none paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six diagnosed with rad scored lower on empathy but higher on selfmonitoring regulating your behavior to look good these differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents and suggested that children with rad may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children\\nepidemiology\\nepidemiological data are limited but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon the prevalence of rad is unclear but it is probably quite rare other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme deprived settings such as some orphanages there is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on rad a cohort study of 211 copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 09\\nattachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the childs basic attachment needs but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder studies undertaken on children from eastern european orphanages from the mid1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of rad and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children regardless of how long they had been there it would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers the difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the followup study three years later although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness however even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder\\na 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in bucharest in which the dai was used challenged the current dsm and icd conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child\\nthere are two studies on the incidence of rad relating to high risk and maltreated children in the us both used icd dsm and the dai the first in 2004 reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the dsm or icd classified rad or dad the second study also in 2004 attempted to ascertain the prevalence of rad and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care 35 were identified as having icd rad and 22 as having icd dad and 38 fulfilled the dsm criteria for rad this study found that rad could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent however there are some methodological concerns with this study a number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for rad did in fact have a preferred attachment figure\\nit has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that rad may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment which is known to increase risk for rad is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to rad behaviors the apsac taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to rad behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties further many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders resilience is a common and normal human characteristic rad does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children adoptive children or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse andor neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of rad\\nthere are few data on comorbid conditions but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which rad arises such as institutionalization or maltreatment these are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect conduct disorders oppositional defiant disorder anxiety disorders posttraumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with rad attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors\\nhistory\\nreactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in dsmiii 1980 following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children the criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive both these features were dropped in dsmiiir 1987 instead onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories inhibited and disinhibited these changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version dsmiv 1994 and its 2000 text revision dsmivtr as well as in icd10 1992 both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance\\nthe broad theoretical framework for current versions of rad is attachment theory based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by john bowlby mary ainsworth and ren spitz attachment theory is a framework that employs psychological ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to seek proximity to a particular attachment figure familiar caregiver in situations of alarm or distress behavior which appears to have survival value this is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment subsequently the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment returning periodically to the familiar person attachment is not the same as love andor affection although they are often associated attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individuals feelings thoughts and expectations in later relationships for a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder the childs history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment\\nthe pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns known as styles or patterns there are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research these are known as secure anxiousambivalent anxiousavoidant all organized and disorganized the latter three are characterised as insecure these are assessed using the strange situation procedure designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all\\na securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present engage with strangers be visibly upset when the caregiver departs and happy to see the caregiver return the anxiousambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns the anxiousavoidant toddler will not explore much avoid or ignore the parentshowing little emotion when the parent departs or returnsand treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown the disorganizeddisoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance on reunion with the caregiver these children can look dazed or frightened freezing in place backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought it is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions\\nalthough there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies particularly the disorganized style none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for rad as such a disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style however problematic that style may be in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles both dsmiv and icd10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such dsmiv emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and icd10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations the relationship between patterns of attachment in the strange situation and rad is not yet clear\\nthere is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term attachment disorder the term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the icd and dsm classifications it is also used within the field of attachment therapy as is the term reactive attachment disorder to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the icd or dsm criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all\\nresearch\\nresearch from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by dsm or icd and showed that rad could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of rad research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior of any style towards the childs permanent caregivers\\nsome authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from rad through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles there is as yet no consensus on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by ch zeanah and n boris the first of these is disorder of attachment in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver the proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to rad in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as defined in dsm and icd the second category is secure base distortion where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment such children may endanger themselves cling to the adult be excessively compliant or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult the third type is disrupted attachment disrupted attachment is not covered under icd10 and dsm criteria and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed this form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current dsmivtr classification but further research is required the practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol most recently daniel schechter and erica willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violencerelated posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion see above which is characterized by child recklessness separation anxiety hypervigilance and rolereversal\\nsome research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of rad or dad and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure\\nan ongoing question is whether rad should be thought of as a disorder of the childs personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person it has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person work by ch zeanah indicates that atypical attachmentrelated behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another this is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles in which a particular parents frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganizeddisoriented reunion behavior during the strange situation procedure\\nthe draft of the proposed dsmv suggests dividing rad into two disorders reactive attachment disorder for the current inhibited form of rad and disinhibited social engagement disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of rad with some alterations in the proposed dsm definition'}, {'title': 'Bladder_cancer', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'bladder

research phenacetin analgesic arsenic and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons in drinking water auramine dye manufacturing magenta dye manufacturing orthotoluidine dye manufacturing epoxy and polyurethane resin hardening agents plastics industry chlornaphazine coaltar pitch occupations at risk are bus drivers rubber workers painters motor mechanics leather including shoe workers blacksmiths machine setters and mechanics hairdressers are thought to be at risk as well because of their frequent exposure to permanent hair dyes\\ninfection with schistosoma haematobium bilharzia or schistosomiasis may cause bladder cancer specially of the squamous cell type schistosoma eggs induces a chronic inflammatory state in the bladder wall resulting in tissue fibrosis higher levels of nnitroso compounds has been detected in urine samples of people with schistosomiasis nnitroso compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis related bladder cancer they cause alkylation dna damage specially guanine to adenine transition mutations in the hras and p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations of p53 are detected in 73 of the tumors bcl2 mutations accounting for 32 and the combination of the two accounting for 13 other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide\\ningestion of aristolochic acid present in many chinese herbal medications has been shown to cause urothelial carcinoma and kidney failure aristolochic acid activates peroxidase in the urothelium and causes transversion mutation in the tp53 tumor suppressor gene\\npeople who undergo external beam radiotherapy ebrt for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer\\nin addition to these major risk factors there are also numerous other modifiable factors that are less strongly ie 1020 risk increase associated with bladder cancer for example obesity although these could be considered as minor effects risk reduction in the general population could still be achieved by reducing the prevalence of a number of smaller risk factor together\\ngenetics\\nmutations in fgfr3 tp53 pik3ca kdm6a arid1a kmt2d hras tert kras crebbp rb1 and tsc1 genes may be associated with some cases of bladder cancer deletions of parts or whole of chromosome 9 is common in bladder cancer low grade cancer are known to harbor mutations in ras pathway and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 fgfr3 gene both of which play a role in the mapkerk pathway p53 and rb gene mutations are implicated in highgrade muscle invasive tumors eighty nine percent of muscle invasive cancers have mutations in chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes\\ndeletion of both copies of the gstm1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer gstm1 gene product glutathione stransferase m1 gstm1 participates in the detoxification process of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke similarly mutations in nat2 nacetyltransferase is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer nacetyltransferase helps in detoxification of carcinogens like aromatic amines also present in cigarette smoke various singlenucleotide polymorphisms in psca gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer psca gene promoter region has an androgen response region loss of reactivity of this region to androgens is hypothesized as a cause of more number of aggressive tumors in women unlike in men who have higher amount of androgen\\nmuscle invasive bladder cancer are heterogeneous in nature in general they can be genetically classified into basal and luminal subtypes basal subtype show alterations involving rb and nfe2l2 and luminal type show changes in fgfr3 and kdm6a genes basal subtype are subdivided into basal and claudin lowtype group and are aggressive and show metastasis at presentation however they respond to platinum based chemotherapy luminal subtype can be subdivided into p53like and luminal p53like tumors of luminal subtype although not as aggressive as basal type show resistance to chemotherapy\\ndiagnosis\\ncurrently the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of cystoscopy which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube called a cystoscope bearing a camera and various instruments are inserted into the bladder through the urethra the flexible procedure allows for a visual inspection of the bladder for minor remedial work to be undertaken and for samples of suspicious lesions to be taken for a biopsy a rigid cystoscope is used under general anesthesia in the operating room and can support remedial work and biopsies as well as more extensive tumor removal unlike papillary lesion which grow into the bladder cavity and are readily visible carcinoma in situ lesion are flat and obscure detection of carcinoma in situ lesions requires multiple biopsies from different areas of interior bladder wall photodynamic detection blue light cystoscopy can aid in the detection of carcinoma in situ in photodynamic detection a dye is instilled into the bladder with the help of a catheter cancer cells take up this dye and are visible under blue light providing visual clues on areas to biopsied or resected\\nhowever visual detection in any form listed above is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification cell type or the stage of the present tumor a socalled cold cup biopsy during an ordinary cystoscopy rigid or flexible will not be sufficient for pathological staging either hence a visual detection needs to be followed by transurethral surgery the procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor turbt further a rectal and vaginal bimanual examination should be carried out before and after the turbt to assess whether there is a palpable mass or if the tumour is fixed tethered to the pelvic wall the pathological classification and staging information obtained by the turbtprocedure is of fundamental importance for making the appropriate choice of ensuing treatment andor followup routines\\nif invasive or high grade includes carcinoma in situ cancer is detected on turbt an mri andor ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and ct chest or xray chest should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread metastasis increase in alkaline phosphatase levels without evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for bone metastasis by a bone scan although 18ffluorodeoxyglucose fdgpositron emission tomography petct has been explored as a viable method for staging there is no consensus to support its role in routine clinical evaluations\\nurine cytology can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy bladder washing cytology is not very sensitive for lowgrade or grade 1 tumors a negative result cannot reliably exclude bladder cancer but has a high specificity a positive result reliably detects bladder cancer there are newer noninvasive urine bound markers available as aids in the diagnosis of bladder cancer including human complement factor hrelated protein highmolecularweight carcinoembryonic antigen and nuclear matrix protein 22 nmp22 in united states the fda has approved nmp22 nmp22 bladderchek and urovysion tests for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer and immunocyt btatrak and btastat tests have been approved for surveillance only btastat and bladderchek can be performed in the clinic and others are done in the laboratory other noninvasive urine based tests include the certndx bladder cancer assay which detects fgfr3 mutation and urine bladder cancer test ubc which is a sandwich elisa for cytokeratin 818 fragment likewise nmp22 is a sandwich elisa and nmp22 bladderchek is a dipstick immunoassay both of them detect nuclear mitotic apparatus protein numa tumor marker a type of nuclear matrix protein urovysion is a fluorescence in situ hybridization which detects aneuploidy in chromosomes 3 7 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus immunocyt is an immunofluorescence test which detects glycosylated cea and mucinlike antigens m344 ldq10 19a11 btastat is a dipstick immunoassay for detection of human complement factor hrelated protein btatrak is a sandwich elisa which also detects human complement factor hrelated protein sensitivities across biomarkers ranged from 057 to 082 and specificities from 074 to 088 biomarkers fared better when used in combination with urine cytology than when used alone however detection accuracy is poor for low grade cancers and 10 cancers are still missed current guidelines do not recommended using urinary biomarkers for detection and surveillance\\nclassification\\nnonpapillary carcinoma includes carcinoma in situ cis microinvasive carcinoma and frankly invasive carcinoma carcinoma in situ cis invariably consists of cytologically highgrade tumour cells\\ntransitional cell carcinoma can undergo differentiation 25 into its variants when seen under a microscope papillary transitional cell carcinoma can present in its typical form or as one of its variations squamous glandular differentiation or micropapillary variant different variations of nonpapillary transitional cell carcinoma are listed below\\nstaging\\nbladder cancer is staged classified by the extent of spread of the cancer and graded how abnormal and aggressive the cells appear under the microscope to determine treatments and estimate outcomes staging usually follows the first transurethral resection of bladder tumor turbt papillary tumors confined to the mucosa or which invade the lamina propria are classified as ta or t1 flat lesion are classified as tis both are grouped together as nonmuscle invasive disease for therapeutic purposes\\nin the tnm staging system 8th edn 2017 for bladder cancer\\nt primary tumour\\nn lymph nodes\\nm distant metastasis\\nthe most common sites for bladder cancer metastases are the lymph nodes bones lung liver and peritoneum the most common sentinel lymph nodes draining bladder cancer are obturator and internal iliac lymph nodes the location of lymphatic spread depends on the location of the tumors tumors on the superolateral bladder wall spread to external iliac lymph nodes tumors on the neck anterior wall and fundus spread commonly to the internal iliac lymph nodes from the regional lymph nodes ie obturator internal and external lymph nodes the cancer spreads to distant sites like the common iliac lymph nodes and paraaortic lymph nodes skipped lymph node lesions are not seen in bladder cancer\\nnumerical\\nltbrgtthe stages above can be integrated into a numerical staging with roman numerals as follows\\ngrading\\naccording to who classification 1973 bladder cancers are histologically graded into\\nwho classification 20042016\\nrisk stratification\\npeople with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer nmibc are riskstratified based on clinical and pathological factors so that they are treated appropriately depending on their probability of having progression andor recurrence people with nonmuscle invasive tumors are categorized into lowrisk intermediaterisk and highrisk or provided with a numerical risk score riskstratification framework is provided by american urology associationsociety of urological oncology auasuo stratification european association of urology eau guidelines european organization for research and treatment of cancer eortc risk tables and club urolgico espaol de tratamiento oncolgico cueto scoring model\\nthe eortc and cueto model use a cumulative score obtained from individual prognostic factors which are then converted into risk of progression and recurrence the six prognostic factors included in the eortc model are number of tumors recurrence rate tstage presence of carcinomainsitu and grade of the tumor scoring for recurrence in the cueto model incorporates 6 variables age gender grade tumor status number of tumors and presence of tis for progression scoring the previous 6 variables plus t stage is used\\nprevention\\nas of 2019 there is limited high level evidence to suggest that eating vegetable and fruits decreases the risk of bladder cancer a 2008 study concluded that specific fruit and vegetables may act to reduce the risk of bladder cancer fruit and yelloworange vegetables particularly carrots and those containing selenium are probably associated with a moderately reduced risk of bladder cancer citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables were also identified as having a possibly protective effect however an analysis of 47909 men in the health professionals followup study showed little relation between cancer reduction and high consumption of fruits and vegetables overall or yellow or green leafy vegetables specifically compared to the reduction seen among those men who consumed large amounts of cruciferous vegetables an inverse relation between intakes of flavonols and lignans diphenolic compounds found in whole grains legumes fruits and vegetables and aggressive bladder cancer has also been described\\nwhile it is suggested that the polyphenol compounds in tea may have an inhibitory effect on bladder tumor formation and growth there is limited evidence to suggesting drinking tea decreases bladder cancer risk\\nin a 10year study involving almost 49000 men researchers found that men who drank at least 144 l of water around 6 cups per day had a reduced risk of bladder cancer when compared with men who drank less it was also found that the risk of bladder cancer decreased by 7 for every 240 ml of fluid added the authors proposed that bladder cancer might partly be caused by the bladder directly contacting carcinogens that are excreted in urine although this has not yet been confirmed in other studies\\nscreening\\nas of 2019 there is insufficient evidence to determine if screening for bladder cancer in people without symptoms is effective or not\\ntreatment\\nthe treatment of bladder cancer depends on how deeply the tumor invades into the bladder wall\\ntreatment strategies for bladder cancer include\\nnonmuscle invasive\\ntransurethral resection\\nnonmuscle invasive bladder cancer those not entering the muscle layer of the bladder can be shaved off using an electrocautery device attached to a cystoscope which in that case is called a resectoscope the procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor turbt and serves primarily for pathological staging in case of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer the turbt is in itself the treatment but in case of muscle invasive cancer the procedure is insufficient for final treatment additionally blue light cystoscopy with opticalimaging agent hexaminolevulinate hal is recommended at initial turbt to increase lesion detection especially carcinoma in situ and improve resection quality thereby reducing recurrence it is important to assess the quality of the resection if there is evidence of incomplete resection or there is no muscle in the specimen without which muscle invasiveness cannot be determined a second turbt is strongly recommended moreover nearly half of the people with high grade noninvasive disease have residual tumor after primary turbt in such cases a second turbt is important for avoiding understaging at this point classifying people into risk groups is recommended treatment and surveillance for different risk groups is indicated in the table below\\nanother method for reducing recurrence of tumors is medication after turbt surgery the two most common medicines used for this purpose are bacillus calmettegurin bcg and mitomycin for people who have already had a turbt procedure bcg may lead to similar risk of death and may reduce the risk of tumor recurrence however this medication may increase the risk of serious unwanted side effects more research is needed to confirm these results\\nchemotherapy\\na single instillation of chemotherapy into the bladder after primary turbt has shown benefit in deceasing recurrence by 35 in nonmuscle invasive disease medications which can used for this purpose are mitomycin c mmc epirubicin pirarubicin and gemcitabine instillation of postoperative chemotherapy should be conducted within first few hours after turbt as time progress residual tumor cells are known to adhere firmly and are covered by extracellular matrix which decrease the efficacy of the instillation the most common side effect is chemical cystitis and skin irritation if there is a suspicion of bladder perforation during turbt chemotherapy should not be instilled into the bladder as serious adverse events are known to occur due to drug extravasation studies have shown that efficacy of chemotherapy is increased by the use of device assisted chemotherapy  these technologies use different mechanisms to facilitate the absorption and action of a chemotherapy drug instilled directly into the bladder another technology  electromotive drug administration emda  uses an electric current to enhance drug absorption after surgical removal of the tumor another technology thermotherapy uses radiofrequency energy to directly heat the bladder wall which together with chemotherapy chemohyperthermia shows a synergistic effect enhancing each others capacity to kill tumor cells\\nimmunotherapy\\nimmunotherapy by bacillus calmettegurin bcg delivery into the bladder is also used to treat and prevent the recurrence of nmibc bcg is a vaccine against tuberculosis that is prepared from attenuated weakened live bovine tuberculosis bacillus mycobacterium bovis that has lost its virulence in humans bcg immunotherapy is effective in up to 23 of the cases at this stage and in randomized trials has been shown to be superior to standard chemotherapy the exact mechanism by which bcg prevents recurrence is unknown however it has been shown that the bacteria are taken up by the cancer cells the infection of these cells in the bladder may trigger a localized immune reaction which clears residual cancer cells\\nbcg is delivered as induction and a maintenance course the induction course consists of 6week course of intravesical and percutaneous bcg this is followed by a maintenance course there is no consensus regarding the maintenance schedule however the most commonly followed is the southwestern oncology group swog schedule the swog maintenance schedule consists of intravesical and percutaneous bcg every week for 3 weeks given at 3 6 12 18 24 30 and 36 months three weekly maintenance regimen with induction has shown complete response rate of 84 compared to 69 in people who received 6week induction bcg only at 6 months many studies have explored alternate treatment schedules and regimes of bcg but has shown no clinical significance efficacy of different strains of bcg connaught tice pasteur tokio172 has been shown not to be different however there is no highlevel evidence\\nside effects of bcg therapy include cystitis prostatitis epididymoorchitis balanitis ureteral obstruction bladder contraction mycobacterial osteomyelitis reactive arthritis mycobacterial pneumonia granulomatous hepatitis granulomatous nephritis interstitial nephritis infectious vasculitis and disseminated infection\\nlocal infection ie prostatitis epididymoorchitis balanitis because of bcg should be treated with triple tubercular therapy with one of the drug being fluoroquinolone for 3 to 6 months in people with systemic infections bcg therapy should be stopped and antitubercular multidrug treatment for atleast 6 months should be started medications that can be used for this treatment are inh rifampicin ethambutol fluoroquinolones clarithromycin aminoglycosides and doxycycline bcg strains are not sensitive to pyrazinamide therefore it should not be a part of antitubercular treatment\\nbcg treatment failure\\nbcg treatment failure can be classified into 3 groups bcg relapse bcgrefractory and bcgintolerant in bcg relapse tumor reoccurs after a disease free period bcgrefractory tumors are the ones which do not respond to induction and maintenance doses of bcg or which progress during therapy in bcgintolerant tumor reoccurs due to incomplete treatment as the person receiving it is unable to tolerate an induction course of bcg around 50 of the people fail bcg treatment and would require further treatment\\npeople whose tumors recurred after treatment with bcg or who were unresponsive to treatment are more difficult to treat in such people a radical cystectomy is recommendation in people who do not show response to bcg therapy and are unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy salvage therapies can be considered salvage therapy include intravesical chemotherapy with agents such as valrubicin gemcitabine or docetaxel chemoradiation or chemohyperthermia\\nmuscle invasive\\nmultimodal therapy standard treatment\\nuntreated nonmuscle invasive tumors may gradually begin to infiltrate the muscular wall of the bladder muscle invasive bladder cancer tumors that infiltrate the bladder wall require more radical surgery where part partial cystectomy or all radical cystectomy of the bladder is removed a cystectomy and the urinary stream is diverted into an isolated bowel loop called an ileal conduit or urostomy in some cases skilled surgeons can create a substitute bladder a neobladder from a segment of intestinal tissue but this largely depends upon a persons preference age of the person renal function and the site of the disease\\na bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy should accompany radical cystectomy at minimum a standard template of lymphadenectomy should be followed by removing the external and internal iliac and obturator lymph node when performing a lymphadenectomy the surgeon can either remove lymph nodes from a smaller standard or from larger extended area in comparison with a standard lymph node dissection having an extended dissection may reduce a persons likelihood of death from any reason including dying from bladder cancer the extended procedure may lead to more serious unwanted effects and may or may not influence the likelihood of the cancer recurring over time the rate of notsoserious side effects may be similar for both surgeries\\nradical cystectomy has a significant morbidity associated with it about 5065 of the people experience complication within 90 days of surgery mortality rates was 7 within 90 days of surgery high volume centers have better outcomes than low volume centers some centers are implementing enhanced recovery after surgery eras society recommendations to decrease morbidity after radical cystectomy however due to lack of specific evidence in urologic surgery eras protocol has not been widely incorporated in urologic clinical care\\neven after surgical removal of bladder 50 of the people with muscle invasive disease t2t4 develop metastatic disease within two years due to micrometastasis in such neoadjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy before main treatment ie surgery has shown to increase overall survival at 5 years from 45 to 50 with an absolute survival benefit of 5 currently the two most used chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant chemotherapy are platinum based methotrexate vinblastine doxorubicin cisplatin mvac and gemcitabine with cisplatin gc other regimens include dose dense mvac ddmvc and cisplatin methotrexate and vinblastine cmv\\nalthough the optimal regimen has not been established the preferred regimen for neoadjuvant therapy is mvac\\nrole of adjuvant chemotherapy chemotherapy after main treatment is limited to people with high grade tumours pt3t4andor n and who have not been treated with neoadjuvant therapy adjuvant radiation therapy has not shown any advantage in bladder cancer treatment\\ntrimodal therapy alternative treatment\\na combination of radiation and chemotherapy chemoradiation in conjunction with transurethral endoscopic bladder tumor resection can be used as an alternative in certain people review of available large data series on this socalled trimodality therapy has indicated similar longterm cancer specific survival rates with improved overall quality of life as for people undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary reconstruction however currently no randomized control trials are available which has compared trimodal therapy with radical cystectomy people who undergo trimodal therapy are usually highly selected and generally have t2 disease without hydronephrosis andor carcinoma insitu five year cancer specific survival and overall survival after trimodal therapy is between 50 to 82 and 36 to 74\\nin trimodal therapy a maximal turbt is conducted followed by chemoradiation therapy radiation sensitizing chemotherapy regimens consisting of cisplatin or 5flurouracil and mitomycin c are used radiation therapy is via external bean radiotherapy ebrt with a target curative dose of 6466 gy surveillance for progression or recurrence should conducted with the aid of ct scans cystoscopies and urine cytology side effects of chemoradiation include nausea vomiting loss of appetite hair loss mouth sores diarrhea constipation increased risk of infections and bleeding and fatigue\\nin people who fail trimodal therapy radical cystectomy is considered if there is muscle invasive or recurrent tumors around 2530 fail treatment and undergo salvage radical cystectomy turbt with intravesical therapy is indicated after treatment failure for nonmuscle invasive disease\\npartial cystectomy\\nin people with solitary tumor without concurrent carcinoma in situ in an area where a clean surgical margins can be achieved a partial cystectomy with lymphadenectomy can be considered management plan including partial cystectomy should be accompanied with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in people with urachal adenocarcinoma of the bladder a partial cystectomy with enbloc resection of urachal ligament and umbilicus can be considered\\nmetastatic disease\\nfirst line treatment\\ncisplatincontaining combination chemotherapy is the standard of care for metastatic bladder care fitness for receiving cisplatin based chemotherapy is assessed before treatment a person is deemed unfit if anyone of the following is true\\npeople who are deemed fit receive platinum based regimens methotrexate vinblastine doxorubicin with cisplatin mvac or gemcitabine with cisplatin gc alternative regimens include paclitaxel with gemcitabine and cisplatin pcg triple therapy and cisplatin methotrexate and vinblastine cmv response rate for cisplatinbased combination ranges from 39 to 65 and complete response is seen in 1235 of the people mvac is better tolerated if it is combined with granulocyte colonystimulating factor and the regimen is known as dose dense mvac regimen ddmvac this combination has shown to decease all cause mortality mvac regimen is aggressive febrile neutropenia fever due to decrease in white blood cells occurs in 10 to 14 and death due to toxicity in about 34 common side effects of mvac include suppression of bone marrow fever due to decrease in white blood cells sepsis mucositis and nausea and vomiting in contrast the gc regimen has shown lower rates of neutropenic sepsis and grade 34 mucositis compared to mvac efforts have been made to increase tolerance of cisplatinbased regimen by replacing it with carboplatinbased chemotherapy however cisplatinbased therapy is superior to carboplatinbased chemotherapy in achieving overall and complete response nevertheless nearly half of the people with metastatic disease are unfit for cisplatinbased therapy in such persons a combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine gemcarbo can be used as first line chemotherapy in people who are not eligible for any platinum based chemotherapy and have pdl1 expression atezolizumab and pembrolizumab can be used\\npeople with bone metastasis should receive bisphosphonates or denosumab to prevent skeletal related events eg fractures spinal cord compression bone pain\\nsecond line treatment\\nbladder cancer that is refractory or shows progression after platinumbased chemotherapy can be treated with secondline chemotherapy or immunotherapy\\nthe most commonly used secondline chemotherapy is singleagent regimes of taxanes paclitaxel nabpaclitaxel and docetaxel other singleagent regimes include vinflunine a third generation vinca alkaloid approved in europe gemcitabine pemetrexed oxaliplatin and ifosfamide side effects of vinflunine include neutropenia constipation fatigue and anemia and has limited its use as a second line agent response to secondline chemotherapy occurs in 520 people median progression free survival with secondline chemotherapy is 34 months\\nin people with fibroblast growth factor receptors fgfr mutations and fail standard platinum based chemotherapy erdafitinib can be used erdafitinib has shown a response rate of 40 in these patients\\nfive immunotherapy agents has been approved in the us for use in metastatic bladder cancer they act by inhibiting programmed celldeath protein 1 pd1 or programmed celldeath ligand 1 pdl1 pembrolizumab and nivolumab and are inhibitors of programmed celldeath ligand 1 pd1 avelumab atezolizumab and durvalumab are inhibitors of pdl1\\npembrolizumab probably improves overall survival a little and may slightly improve quality of life for people with urothelial cancer that has worsened after initial treatment when compared with continued chemotherapy however pembrolizumab may have only minimal effects on the rate of death resulting from treatment or the rate at which the cancer advances pembrolizumab may cause less serious side effects than chemotherapy\\nsurveillance and response\\ncontrast enhanced ct is used to monitor lung liver and lymph node metastases a bone scan is used to detect and monitor bone metastasis treatment response is measured using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors recist into one of the following groups response complete or partial stable disease and progressive disease\\nprognosis\\npeople with nonmuscle invasive tumors have a favorable outcome 5year survival is 95 vs 69 of muscle invasive bladder cancer however 70 of them will have a recurrence after initial treatment with 30 of them presenting with muscle invasive disease recurrence and progression to a higher disease stage have a less favorable outcome\\nsurvival after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is dependent on the pathological stage if the disease has not spread to the lymph node and is limited to the bladder t1 or t2 n0 the 5year survival is 78 if it has spread locally around the region of the bladder with no lymph node involved t3 n0 then the 5year survival drops to 47 in disease with lymph node spread n irrespective of t stage the 5year survival is 31 locally advanced and metastatic disease drastically decreases survival with a median survival of 36 months without chemotherapy cisplatinbased chemotherapy has increased the median survival to 15months however the 5year survival is still 15\\nthere are several prognostic factors which determine cancer specific survival after radical cystectomy factor with detrimental effect of cancer specific survival are old age higher tumor grade and pathological stage lymph node metastasis presence of lymphovascular invasion and positive soft tissue margin lymph node density positive lymph nodestotal lymph nodes observed in the specimen from surgery is a predictor of survival in lymph node positive disease higher the density lower is the survival\\nquality of life\\nafter radical cystectomy urinary and sexual function remain inferior to the general population people who have a neobladder have better emotional function and body image compared with ones with cutaneous diversion who need to wear a bag to collect urine over their abdomen social factors such family relationships health and finances contribute significantly for determining good quality of life in people who have been diagnosed with bladder cancer\\na high percentage of people with bladder cancer have anxiety and depression people who are young single and have advanced clinical disease have a high risk for getting diagnosed with a psychiatric illness posttreatment people who suffer from psychiatric illness post treatment seem to have worse cancer specific and overall survival\\nepidemiology\\nglobally in 2017 bladder cancer resulted in 196000 deaths a 54 age adjusted decrease from 2007 in 2018 the age adjusted rates of new cases of bladder cancer was 6 cases per 100000 people and age adjusted death rate was 2 deaths per 100000 people lebanon and greece have the highest rate of new cases in lebanon this high risk is attributed to high number of smokers and petrochemical air pollution\\nthe risk of bladder cancer occurrence is four times higher in men than in women smoking can only partially explain this higher rates in men in western hemisphere one other reason is that the androgen receptor which is much more active in men than in women may play a part in the development of the cancer this hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer in africa men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with schistosoma this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic however women present with more aggressive disease and have worse outcomes than men this difference in outcomes is attributed to numerous factors such as difference in carcinogen exposure genetics social and quality of care one of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women leading to a delay in diagnosis moreover as mentioned earlier psca gene may play a role in aggressive tumors in women\\ncanada\\nbladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 37 of the new cancer cases in 2018 30700 canadians were living with bladder cancer 9160 new cases were diagnosed and 2467 died from it in 2019 it is estimated that 11800 new cases will be diagnosed and 2500 will die from it among the 11800 new cases 9100 will be in men and 2700 in women of the 2500 who would die from it 1800 will be men and 700 will be women\\nchina\\nbladder cancer is the 14th most common cancer and 16th most common

'colorectal cancer crc also known as bowel cancer colon cancer or rectal cancer is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum parts of the large intestine signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool a change in bowel movements weight loss and fatigue\\nmost colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders risk factors include diet obesity smoking and lack of physical activity dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat processed meat and alcohol another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease which includes crohns disease and ulcerative colitis some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer however these represent less than 5 of cases it typically starts as a benign tumor often in the form of a polyp which over time becomes cancerous\\nbowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy this is then followed by medical imaging to determine whether the disease has spread screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer screening by one of a number of methods is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75 during colonoscopy small polyps may be removed if found if a large polyp or tumor is found a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs decrease the risk their general use is not recommended for this purpose however due to side effects\\ntreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery radiation therapy chemotherapy and targeted therapy cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms the fiveyear survival rate in the united states is around 65 the individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery and the persons overall health globally colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer making up about 10 of all cases in 2018 there were 109 million new cases and 551000 deaths from the disease it is more common in developed countries where more than 65 of cases are found it is less common in women than men\\nsigns and symptoms\\nthe signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body metastasis the classic warning signs include worsening constipation blood in the stool decrease in stool caliber thickness loss of appetite loss of weight and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old around 50 of individuals with colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms\\nrectal bleeding or anemia are highrisk symptoms in people over the age of 50 weight loss and changes in a persons bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding\\ncause\\n7595 of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk risk factors include older age male sex high intake of fat sugar alcohol red meat processed meats obesity smoking and a lack of physical exercise approximately 10 of cases are linked to insufficient activity the risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day drinking 5 glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer some strains of streptococcus bovisstreptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe 25 to 80 of people with streptococcus bovisgallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors seroprevalence of streptococcus bovisgallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population it has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to streptococcus bovisgallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon\\npathogenic escherichia coli may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite colibactin\\ninflammatory bowel disease\\npeople with inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis and crohns disease are at increased risk of colon cancer the risk increases the longer a person has the disease and the worse the severity of inflammation in these high risk groups both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended endoscopic surveillance in this highrisk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer people with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2 of colon cancer cases yearly in those with crohns disease 2 get colorectal cancer after 10\\xa0years 8 after 20\\xa0years and 18 after\\xa030 years in people who have ulcerative colitis approximately 16 develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30\\xa0years\\ngenetics\\nthose with a family history in two or more firstdegree relatives such as a parent or sibling have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20 of all cases a number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer the most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc or lynch syndrome which is present in about 3 of people with colorectal cancer other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis fap for people with these syndromes cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1 of the cancer cases a total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with fap as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy colectomy removal of the colon may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains the most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome which is associated with a 2540 risk of crc\\nmutations in the pair of genes pole and pold1 have been associated with familial colon cancer\\nmost deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease a gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 macc1 has been isolated it is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor this gene is associated with the proliferation invasion and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture and tumor growth and metastasis in mice macc1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies\\nepigenetic factors such as abnormal dna methylation of tumor suppressor promoters play a role in the development of colorectal cancer\\nashkenazi jews have a 6 higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the apc gene being more common\\npathogenesis\\ncolorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract most frequently as a result of mutations in the wnt signaling pathway that increase signaling activity the mutations can be inherited or acquired and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell the most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the apc gene which produces the apc protein the apc protein prevents the accumulation of catenin protein without apc catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates moves into the nucleus binds to dna and activates the transcription of protooncogenes these genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation but when inappropriately expressed at high levels they can cause cancer while apc is mutated in most colon cancers some cancers have increased catenin because of mutations in catenin ctnnb1 that block its own breakdown or have mutations in other genes with function similar to apc such as axin1 axin2 tcf7l2 or nkd1\\nbeyond the defects in the wnt signaling pathway other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous the p53 protein produced by the tp53 gene normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have wnt pathway defects eventually a cell line acquires a mutation in the tp53 gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated but another protective protein named bax is mutated instead\\nother proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are tgf and dcc deleted in colorectal cancer tgf has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers sometimes tgf is not deactivated but a downstream protein named smad is deactivated dcc commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer\\napproximately 70 of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer with just over 1 of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer some genes are oncogenes they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer for example genes encoding the proteins kras raf and pi3k which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors can acquire mutations that result in overactivation of cell proliferation the chronological order of mutations is sometimes important if a previous apc mutation occurred a primary kras mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a selflimiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion pten a tumor suppressor normally inhibits pi3k but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated\\ncomprehensive genomescale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and nonhypermutated tumor types in addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above nonhypermutated samples also contain mutated ctnnb1 fam123b sox9 atm and arid1a progressing through a distinct set of genetic events hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of acvr2a tgfbr2 msh3 msh6 slc9a9 tcf7l2 and braf the common theme among these genes across both tumor types is their involvement in wnt and tgf signaling pathways which results in increased activity of myc a central player in colorectal cancer\\nmismatch repair mmr deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high amount of polynucleotide tandem repeats this is caused by a deficiency in mmr proteins  which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations eg lynch syndrome 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have mmr deficiencies with 3 percent developing due to lynch syndrome the role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells ie error detecting and correcting consequently a deficiency in mmr proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage allowing for further cancercausing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress\\nthe polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis the polyp to cancer sequence describes the phases of transition from benign tumours into colorectal cancer over many years central to the polyp to crc sequence are gene mutations epigenetic alterations and local inflammatory changes the polyp to crc sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes\\nfield defects\\nthe term field cancerization was first used in 1953 to describe an area or field of epithelium that has been preconditioned by what were largely unknown processes at the time to predispose it towards development of cancer since then the terms field cancerization field carcinogenesis field defect and field effect have been used to describe premalignant or preneoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise\\nfield defects are important in progression to colon cancer\\nhowever as pointed out by rubin the vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on welldefined tumors in vivo or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro yet there is evidence that more than 80 of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion similarly vogelstein et al pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a preneoplastic phase in a field defect during growth of apparently normal cells likewise epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in preneoplastic field defects\\nan expanded view of field effect has been termed etiologic field effect which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in preneoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death\\nepigenetics\\nepigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic mutational alterations as described by vogelstein et al an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations together designated driver mutations with about 60 further passenger mutations the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under pathogenesis\\nin addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of mirnas other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of cpg islands of proteinencoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression as an example 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers of the hypermethylated genes 10 were hypermethylated in 100 of colon cancers and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50 of colon cancers in addition 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of mirnas were also associated with colorectal cancers abnormal aberrant methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older the source and trigger of this agerelated methylation is unknown approximately half of the genes that show agerelated methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer these findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer\\nepigenetic reductions of dna repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer as summarized in the articles carcinogenesis and neoplasm for sporadic cancers in general a deficiency in dna repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a dna repair gene but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of dna repair genes\\nepigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a persons response to chemotherapy\\ngenomics  epigenomics\\nconsensus molecular subtypes cms classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015 cms classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for crc that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtypebased targeted interventions\\na novel epigenomebased classification epic of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with crc chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify epic subtypes a combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes cmss and epics could significantly enhance current treatment strategies\\ndiagnosis\\ncolorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy depending on the location of the lesion it is confirmed by microscopical examination of a tissue sample\\nmedical imaging\\na colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on ct scan\\npresence of metastases is determined by a ct scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis other potential imaging tests such as pet and mri may be used in certain cases the latter is often used for rectal lesions to determine its local stage and to facilitate preoperative planning\\nhistopathology\\nthe histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery a pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed the most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma constituting between 95 to 98 of all cases of colorectal cancer other rarer types include lymphoma adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma some subtypes have been found to be more aggressive immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases\\nstaging\\nstaging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings as with most other forms of cancer tumor staging is based on the tnm system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs the ajcc 8th edition was published in 2018\\nprevention\\nit has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors and about a quarter of all cases are preventable increasing surveillance engaging in physical activity consuming a diet high in fiber and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk\\nlifestyle\\nlifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise cigarette smoking alcohol and obesity the risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet\\ncurrent research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease starting in the 1970s dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains fruits and vegetables and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats this was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies however large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions outside of eating a healthy diet will have significant protective effects in 2018 the national cancer institute stated that there is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of crc by a clinically important degree\\naccording to the world cancer research fund consuming alcohol drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer \\nwith regard to dietary fiber the 2014 world health organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer but most studies have not borne this out and status of the science remained unclear as of 2014 a 2019 review however found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains the world cancer research fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as probable as of 2017\\nhigher physical activity is recommended physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk high levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21 sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer the risk is not negated by regular exercise though it is lowered\\nmedication and supplements\\naspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old do not have an increased risk of bleeding and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer it is not recommended in those at average risk\\nthere is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation vitamin d intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer\\nscreening\\nas more than 80 of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 23 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms any polyps that are detected can be removed usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and thus prevent them from turning into cancer screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60\\nthe three main screening tests are colonoscopy fecal occult blood testing and flexible sigmoidoscopy of the three only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42 of cancers are found flexible sigmoidoscopy however has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause\\nfecal occult blood testing fobt of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiacbased or immunochemical if abnormal fobt results are found participants are typically referred for a followup colonoscopy examination when done once every 12 years fobt screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16 and among those participating in screening colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23 although it has not been proven to reduce allcause mortality immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing\\nother options include virtual colonoscopy and stool dna screening testing fitdna virtual colonoscopy via a ct scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive associated with radiation exposure and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can stool dna screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions including altered dna and blood hemoglobin a positive result should be followed by colonoscopy fitdna has more false positives than fit and thus results in more adverse effects further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a threeyear screening interval is correct\\nrecommendations\\nin the united states screening is typically recommended between ages 50 to 75\\xa0years the american cancer society recommends starting at the age of 45 for those between 76 and 85 years old the decision to screen should be individualized for those at high risk screenings usually begin at around 40\\nseveral screening methods are recommended including stoolbased tests every 2 years sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years and colonoscopy every 10 years it is unclear which of these two methods is better colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon but is associated with greater cost and more complications for people with average risk who have had a highquality colonoscopy with normal results the american gastroenterological association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy for people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10\\xa0years screening is not recommended it takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit the uspstf list seven potential strategies for screening with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used\\nin canada among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk fecal immunochemical testing or fobt is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years colonoscopy is less preferred\\nsome countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer fobt screening for all adults within a certain age group typically starting between ages 50 to 60 examples of countries with organised screening include the united kingdom australia the netherlands hong kong and taiwan\\ntreatment\\nthe treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation the decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors including the persons health and preferences as well as the stage of the tumor assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not when colorectal cancer is caught early surgery can be curative however when it is detected at later stages for which metastases are present this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible\\nsurgery\\nif the cancer is found at an early stage it may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection for people with localized cancer the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins with the attempt of achieving a cure the procedure of choice is a partial colectomy or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes this can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors the colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy\\nif there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs these may also be removed chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it the two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs for peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery sometimes in combination with hipec can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer\\nchemotherapy\\nin both cancer of the colon and rectum chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases the decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease\\nin stage i colon cancer no chemotherapy is offered and surgery is the definitive treatment the role of chemotherapy in stage ii colon cancer is debatable and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as t4 tumor undifferentiated tumor vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified it is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy for stage iii and stage iv colon cancer chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment\\nif cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs which is the case with stage iii and stage iv colon cancer respectively adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy if the lymph nodes do not contain cancer the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial if the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable treatment is then palliative typically in this setting a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine fluorouracil irinotecan oxaliplatin and uft the drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine some specific regimens used for crc are capox folfox folfoxiri and folfiri antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors of which the three fda approved ones are aflibercept cetuximab and panitumumab\\nthe primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy often it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection so that ultimately a colostomy is not required however it may not be possible in low lying tumors in which case a permanent colostomy may be required stage iv rectal cancer is treated similar to stage iv colon cancer\\nstage iv colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using hipec combined with cytoreductive surgery in some people\\nradiation therapy\\nwhile a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer for some people requiring treatment chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatmentrelated toxicity and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone although it is associated with less local recurrence the use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation as with chemotherapy radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages t3 and t4 for rectal cancer this results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour preparing it for surgical resection and also decreases local recurrence rates for locally advanced rectal cancer neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment additionally when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against crc pulmonary metastases which are developed by 1015 of people with crc\\nimmunotherapy\\nimmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability pembrolizumab is approved for advanced crc tumours that are mmr deficient and have failed usual treatments most people who do improve however still worsen after months or years other types of colorectal cancer as of 2017 is still being studied\\npalliative care\\npalliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms\\ninvolvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family by improving symptoms anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital\\nin people with incurable colorectal cancer palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer thereby improving quality of life surgical options may include noncurative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue bypassing part of the intestines or stent placement these procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction nonoperative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications\\nfollowup\\nthe us national comprehensive cancer network and american society of clinical oncology provide guidelines for the followup of colon cancer a medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years then every 6 months for 5 years carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing but are only advised for people with t2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention a ctscan of the chest abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence for example those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion and are candidates for curative surgery with the aim to cure a colonoscopy can be done after 1 year except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months if a villous polyp a polyp gt1 centimeter or highgrade dysplasia is found it can be repeated after 3 years then every 5 years for other abnormalities the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year\\nroutine pet or ultrasound scanning chest xrays complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended\\nfor people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy or both to treat nonmetastatic colorectal cancer intense surveillance and close followup have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits\\nexercise\\nexercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors in epidemiological studies exercise may decrease colorectal cancerspecific mortality and allcause mortality results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting these differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers people with tumors that lacked ctnnb1 expression catenin involved in wnt signalling pathway required more than 18 metabolic equivalent met hours per week a measure of exercise to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality the mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways in clinical studies a proinflammatory response was found in people with stage iiiii colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed a significant decrease in 8oxodg was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sexsteroid hormones although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers\\nanother potential biomarker may be p27 survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 met hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 met hours per week survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes the constitutive activation of pi3kaktmtor pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may upregulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing\\nphysical activity provides benefits to people with nonadvanced colorectal cancer improvements in aerobic fitness cancerrelated fatigue and healthrelated quality of life have been reported in the short term however these improvements were not observed at the level of diseaserelated mental health such as anxiety and depression\\nprognosis\\nfewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer these include both unfavorable genes where high expression is related to poor outcome for example the heat shock 70 kda protein 1 hspa1a and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival for example the putative rnabinding protein 3 rbm3\\nrecurrence rates\\nthe average fiveyear recurrence rate in people where surgery is successful is 5 for stage i cancers 12 in stage ii and 33 in stage iii however depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 922 in stage ii and 1744 in stage iii\\nsurvival rates\\nin europe the fiveyear survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60 in the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it\\nsurvival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers as they are typically quite advanced survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers people with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa tnm stage tis n0 m0 have a fiveyear survival rate of 100 while those with invasive cancer of t1 within the submucosal layer or t2 within the muscular layer have an average fiveyear survival rate of approximately 90 those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement t34 n0 m0 have an average fiveyear survival rate of approximately 70 people with positive regional lymph nodes any t n13 m0 have an average fiveyear survival rate of approximately 40 while those with distant metastases any t any n m1 have a poor prognosis and the five year survival ranges from lt5 percent to 31 percent the prognosis depends on a multitude of factors which include the physical fitness level of the person extent of metastases and tumor grade\\nwhilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment for example it is common for people to experience incontinence sexual dysfunction problems with stoma care and fear of cancer recurrence after primary treatment has concluded\\na qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer support mechanisms severity of late effects of treatment and psychosocial adjustment therefore it is essential that people are offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment\\nepidemiology\\nglobally more than 1\\xa0million people get colorectal cancer every year resulting in about 715000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490000 in 1990\\n it is the second most common cause of cancer in women 92 of diagnoses and the third most common in men 100 with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung stomach and liver cancer it is more common in developed than developing countries globally incidences vary 10fold with

colorectal cancer before the age of 75 one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age\\npapua new guinea\\nin the developing countries like papua new guinea and other pacific island states including the solomon islands colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people which is least common compared to lung stomach liver or breast cancer it is estimated that at least 8 in 100000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year which is unlike lung or breast cancer where for the latter alone is 24 in 100000 of the women folks alone \\nhistory\\nrectal cancer has been diagnosed in an ancient egyptian mummy who had lived in the dakhleh oasis during the ptolemaic period\\nsociety and culture\\nin the united states march is colorectal cancer awareness month\\nresearch\\npreliminary invitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria eg lactobacilli streptococci or lactococci may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity immunomodulation promoting programmed cell death antiproliferative effects and epigenetic modification of cancer cells\\nmouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer have been developed and are used in research'}, {'title': 'Failed_back_syndrome', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'failed back syndrome or postlaminectomy syndrome is a condition characterized by chronic pain following back surgeries many factors can contribute to the onset or development of fbs including residual or recurrent spinal disc herniation persistent postoperative pressure on a spinal nerve altered joint mobility joint hypermobility with instability scar tissue fibrosis depression anxiety sleeplessness spinal muscular deconditioning and even cutibacterium acnes infection an individual may be predisposed to the development of fbs due to systemic disorders such as diabetes autoimmune disease and peripheral blood vessels vascular disease \\ncommon symptoms associated with fbs include diffuse dull and aching pain involving the back or legs abnormal sensibility may include sharp pricking and stabbing pain in the extremities the term postlaminectomy syndrome is used by some doctors to indicate the same condition as failed back syndrome\\nthe treatments of postlaminectomy syndrome include physical therapy microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator minor nerve blocks transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation tens behavioral medicine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory nsaid medications membrane stabilizers antidepressants spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal morphine pump use of epidural steroid injections may be minimally helpful in some cases the targeted anatomic use of a potent antiinflammatory antitnf therapeutics is being investigated\\nthe number of spinal surgeries varies around the world the united states and the netherlands report the highest number of spinal surgeries while the united kingdom and sweden report the fewest recently there have been calls for more aggressive surgical treatment in europe success rates of spinal surgery vary for many reasons\\ncause\\npatients who have undergone one or more operations on the lumbar spine and continue to experience pain afterward can be divided into two groups the first group comprise those in whom surgery was not actually indicated or the surgery performed was not likely to achieve the desired result and those in whom surgery was indicated but which technically did not achieve the intended result patients whose pain complaints are of a radicular nature have a better chance for a good outcome than those whose pain complaints are limited to pain in the back\\nthe second group includes patients who had incomplete or inadequate operations lumbar spinal stenosis may be overlooked especially when it is associated with disc protrusion or herniation removal of a disc while not addressing the underlying presence of stenosis can lead to disappointing results occasionally operating on the wrong level occurs as does failure to recognize an extruded or sequestered disc fragment inadequate or inappropriate surgical exposure can lead to other problems in not getting to the underlying pathology hakelius reported a 3 incidence of serious nerve root damage\\nin 1992 turner et al published a survey of 74 journal articles which reported the results after decompression for spinal stenosis good to excellent results were on average reported by 64 of the patients there was however a wide variation in outcomes reported there was a better result in patients who had a degenerative spondylolisthesis a similarly designed study by mardjekto et al found that a concomitant spinal arthrodesis fusion had a greater success rate herron and trippi evaluated 24 patients all with degenerative spondylolisthesis treated with laminectomy alone at followup varying between 18 and 71 months after surgery 20 out of the 24 patients reported a good result epstein reported on 290 patients treated over a 25year period excellent results were obtained in 69 and good results in 13 these optimistic reports do not correlate with return to competitive employment rates which for the most part are dismal in most spinal surgery series\\nin the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in fusion surgery in the us in 2001 over 122000 lumbar fusions were performed a 22 increase from 1990 in fusions per 100000 population increasing to an estimate of 250000 in 2003 and 500000 in 2006 in 2003 the national bill for the hardware for fusion alone was estimated to have soared to 25 billion a year\\nfor patients with continued pain after surgery which is not due to the above complications or conditions interventional pain physicians speak of the need to identify the pain generator ie the anatomical structure responsible for the patients pain to be effective the surgeon must operate on the correct anatomic structure but is often not possible to determine the source of the pain the reason for this is that many patients with chronic pain often have disc bulges at multiple spinal levels and the physical examination and imaging studies are unable to pinpoint the source of pain in addition spinal fusion itself particularly if more than one spinal level is operated on may result in adjacent segment degeneration this is thought to occur because the fused segments may result in increased torsional and stress forces being transmitted to the intervertebral discs located above and below the fused vertebrae this pathology is one reason behind the development of artificial discs as a possible alternative to fusion surgery but fusion surgeons argue that spinal fusion is more timetested and artificial discs contain metal hardware that is unlikely to last as long as biological material without shattering and leaving metal fragments in the spinal canal these represent different schools of thought see discussion on disc replacement infra\\nanother highly relevant consideration is the increasing recognition of the importance of chemical radiculitis in the generation of back pain a primary focus of surgery is to remove pressure or reduce mechanical compression on a neural element either the spinal cord or a nerve root but it is increasingly recognized that back pain rather than being solely due to compression may instead entirely be due to chemical inflammation of the nerve root it has been known for several decades that disc herniations result in a massive inflammation of the associated nerve root in the past five years increasing evidence has pointed to a specific inflammatory mediator of this pain this inflammatory molecule called tumor necrosis factoralpha tnf is released not only by the herniated or protruding disc but also in cases of disc tear annular tear by facet joints and in spinal stenosis in addition to causing pain and inflammation tnf may also contribute to disc degeneration if the cause of the pain is not compression but rather is inflammation mediated by tnf then this may well explain why surgery might not relieve the pain and might even exacerbate it resulting in fbss\\nrole of sacroiliac joint sij in lower back pain lbp\\na 2005 review by cohen concludedthe si joint is a real yet underappreciated pain generator in an estimated 15 to 25 of patients with axial lbp studies by ha et al show that the incidence of si joint degeneration in postlumbar fusion surgery is 75 at 5 years postsurgery based on imaging studies by depalma and liliang et al demonstrate that 4061 of postlumbar fusion patients were symptomatic for si joint dysfunction based on diagnostic blocks\\nsmoking\\nrecent studies have shown that cigarette smokers will routinely fail all spinal surgery if the goal of that surgery is the decrease of pain and impairment many surgeons consider smoking to be an absolute contraindication to spinal surgery nicotine appears to interfere with bone metabolism through induced calcitonin resistance and decreased osteoblastic function it may also restrict small blood vessel diameter leading to increased scar formation\\nthere is an association between cigarette smoking back pain and chronic pain syndromes of all types\\nin a report of 426 spinal surgery patients in denmark smoking was shown to have a negative effect on fusion and overall patient satisfaction but no measurable influence on the functional outcome\\nthere is a validation of the hypothetical assumption that postoperative smoking cessation helps to reverse the impact of cigarette smoking on outcome after spinal fusion if patients cease cigarette smoking in the immediate post operative period there is a positive impact on success\\nregular smoking in adolescence was associated with low back pain in young adults packyears of smoking showed an exposureresponse relationship among girls\\na recent study suggested that cigarette smoking adversely affects serum hydrocodone levels prescribing physicians should be aware that in some cigarette smokers serum hydrocodone levels might not be detectable\\nin a study from denmark reviewing many reports in the literature it was concluded that smoking should be considered a weak risk indicator and not a cause of low back pain in a multitude of epidemiologic studies an association between smoking and low back pain has been reported but variations in approach and study results make this literature difficult to reconcile \\nin a massive study of 3482 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery from the national spine network comorbidities of 1 smoking 2 compensation 3 self reported poor overall health and 4 preexisting psychological factors were predictive in a high risk of failure followup was carried out at 3 months and one year after surgery preoperative depressive disorders tended not to do well\\nsmoking has been shown to increase the incidence of post operative infection as well as decrease fusion rates one study showed 90 of post operative infections occurred in smokers as well as myonecrosis muscle destruction around the wound\\npathology\\nbefore the advent of ct scanning the pathology in failed back syndrome was difficult to understand computerized tomography in conjunction with metrizamide myelography in the late 1960s and 1970s allowed direct observation of the mechanisms involved in post operative failures six distinct pathologic conditions were identified\\nrecurrent or persistent disc herniation\\nremoval of a disc at one level can lead to disc herniation at a different level at a later time even the most complete surgical excision of the disc still leaves 3040 of the disc which cannot be safely removed this retained disc can reherniate sometime after surgery virtually every major structure in the abdomen and the posterior retroperitoneal space has been injured at some point by removing discs using posterior laminectomydiscectomy surgical procedures the most prominent of these is a laceration of the left internal iliac vein which lies in close proximity to the anterior portion of the disc in some studies recurrent pain in the same radicular pattern or a different pattern can be as high as 50 after disc surgery many observers have noted that the most common cause of a failed back syndrome is caused from recurrent disc herniation at the same level originally operated a rapid removal in a second surgery can be curative the clinical picture of a recurrent disc herniation usually involves a significant painfree interval however physical findings may be lacking and a good history is necessary the time period for the emergence of new symptoms can be short or long diagnostic signs such as the straight leg raise test may be negative even if real pathology is present the presence of a positive myelogram may represent a new disc herniation but can also be indicative of a post operative scarring situation simply mimicking a new disc newer mri imaging techniques have clarified this dilemma somewhat conversely a recurrent disc can be difficult to detect in the presence of post op scarring myelography is inadequate to completely evaluate the patient for recurrent disc disease and ct or mri scanning is necessary measurement of tissue density can be helpful\\neven though the complications of laminectomy for disc herniation can be significant a recent series of studies involving thousands of patients published under auspices of dartmouth medical school concluded at fouryear followup that those who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients in all primary and secondary outcomes except work status\\nspinal stenosis\\nspinal stenosis can be a late complication after laminectomy for disc herniation or when surgery was performed for the primary pathologic condition of spinal stenosis \\nin the maine study among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis completing 8 to 10year followup low back pain relief predominant symptom improvement and satisfaction with the current state were similar in patients initially treated surgically or nonsurgically however leg pain relief and greater backrelated functional status continued to favor those initially receiving surgical treatment\\na large study of spinal stenosis from finland found the prognostic factors for ability to work after surgery were ability to work before surgery age under 50 years and no prior back surgery the very longterm outcome mean followup time of 124 years was excellenttogood in 68 of patients 59 women and 73 men furthermore in the longitudinal followup the result improved between 1985 and 1991 no special complications were manifested during this very longterm followup time the patients with total or subtotal block in preoperative myelography achieved the best result furthermore patients with block stenosis improved their result significantly in the longitudinal followup the postoperative stenosis seen in computed tomography ct scans was observed in 65 of 90 patients and it was severe in 23 patients 25 however this successful or unsuccessful surgical decompression did not correlate with patients subjective disability walking capacity or severity of pain previous back surgery had a strong worsening effect on surgical results this effect was very clear in patients with total block in the preoperative myelography the surgical result of a patient with previous back surgery was similar to that of a patient without previous back surgery when the time interval between the last two operations was more than 18 months\\npostoperative mri findings of stenosis are probably of limited value compared to symptoms experienced by patients patients perception of improvement had a much stronger correlation with longterm surgical outcome than structural findings seen on postoperation magnetic resonance imaging degenerative findings had a greater effect on patients walking capacity than stenotic findings\\npostoperative radiologic stenosis was very common in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis but this did not correlate with clinical outcome the clinician must be cautious when reconciling clinical symptoms and signs with postoperative computed tomography findings in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis\\na study from georgetown university reported on onehundred patients who had undergone decompressive surgery for lumbar stenosis between 1980 and 1985 four patients with postfusion stenosis were included a 5year followup period was achieved in 88 patients the mean age was 67 years and 80 were over 60 years of age there was a high incidence of coexisting medical diseases but the principal disability was lumbar stenosis with neurological involvement initially there was a high incidence of success but recurrence of neurological involvement and persistence of lowback pain led to an increasing number of failures by 5 years this number had reached 27 of the available population pool suggesting that the failure rate could reach 50 within the projected life expectancies of most patients of the 26 failures 16 were secondary to renewed neurological involvement which occurred at new levels of stenosis in eight and recurrence of stenosis at operative levels in eight reoperation was successful in 12 of these 16 patients but two required a third operation the incidence of spondylolisthesis at 5 years was higher in the surgical failures 12 of 26 patients than in the surgical successes 16 of 64 spondylolisthetic stenosis tended to recur within a few years following decompression because of age and associated illnesses fusion may be difficult to achieve in this group\\npost operative infection\\na small minority of lumbar surgical patients will develop a post operative infection in most cases this is a bad complication and does not bode well for eventual improvement or future employability reports from the surgical literature indicate an infection rate anywhere from 0 to almost 12 the incidence of infection tends to increase as the complexity of the procedure and operating time increase usage of metal implants instrumentation tends to increase the risk of infection factors associated with an increased infection include diabetes mellitus obesity malnutrition smoking previous infection rheumatoid arthritis and immunodeficiency\\nprevious wound infection should be considered as a contraindication to any further spinal surgery since the likelihood of improving such patients with more surgery is small\\nantimicrobial prophylaxis giving antibiotics during or after surgery before an infection begins reduces the rate of surgical site infection in lumbar spine surgery but a great deal of variation exists regarding its use in a japanese study utilizing the centers for disease control recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis an overall rate of 07 infection was noted with a single dose antibiotic group having 04 infection rate and multiple dosage antibiotic infection rate of 08 the authors had previously used prophylactic antibiotics for 5 to 7 postoperative days based on the centers for disease control and prevention guideline their antibiotic prophylaxis was changed to the day of surgery only it was concluded there was no statistical difference in the rate of infection between the two different antibiotic protocols based on the cdc guideline a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic was proven to be efficacious for the prevention of infection in lumbar spine surgeries\\nepidural postoperative fibrosis\\nepidural scarring following a laminectomy for disc excision is a common feature when reoperating for recurrent sciatica or radiculopathy when the scarring is associated with a disc herniation andor recurrent spinal stenosis it is relatively common occurring in more than 60 of cases for a time it was theorized that placing a fat graft over the dural could prevent post operative scarring however initial enthusiasm has waned in recent years in an extensive laminectomy involving 2 or more vertebra post operative scarring is the norm it is most often seen around the l5 and s1 nerve roots\\nadhesive arachnoiditis\\nfibrous scarring can also be a complication within the subarachnoid space it is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate prior to the development of magnetic resonance imaging the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura in the days of ct scanning and pantopaque and later metrizamide myelography the presence of arachnoiditis could be speculated based on radiographic findings often myelography prior to the introduction of metrizamide was the cause of arachnoiditis it can also be caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis the presence of both epidural scarring and arachnoiditis in the same patient are probably quite common \\narachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space a variety of causes exist including infectious inflammatory and neoplastic processes\\ninfectious causes include bacterial viral fungal and parasitic agents noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery intrathecal hemorrhage and the administration of intrathecal inside the dural canal agents such as myelographic contrast media anesthetics eg chloroprocaine and steroids eg depomedrol kenalog lately iatrogenic arachnoiditis has been attributed to misplaced epidural steroid injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally the preservatives and suspension agents found in all steroid injectates which arent indicated for epidural administration by the us food amp drug administration due to reports of severe adverse events including arachnoiditis paralysis and death have now been directly linked to the onset of the disease following the initial stage of chemical meningitis \\nneoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors such as breast and lung carcinoma melanoma and nonhodgkin lymphoma neoplasia also includes direct seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid csf from primary central nervous system cns tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme medulloblastoma ependymoma and choroid plexus carcinoma strictly speaking the most common cause of arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer it is due to nonspecific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology \\nnerve injury\\nlaceration of a nerve root or damage from cautery or traction can lead to chronic pain however this can be difficult to determine chronic compression of the nerve root by a persistent agent such as disc bone osteophyte or scarring can also permanently damage the nerve root epidural scarring caused by the initial pathology or occurring after the surgery can also contribute to nerve damage in one study of failed back patients the presence of pathology was noted to be at the same site as the level of surgery performed in 57 of cases the remaining cases developed pathology at a different level or on the opposite side but at the same level as the surgery was performed in theory all failed back patients have some sort of nerve injury or damage which leads to a persistence of symptoms after a reasonable healing time\\navoiding postlaminectomylaminotomy syndrome\\nsmaller procedures that do not remove bone such as endoscopic transforaminal lumbar discectomy and reconfiguration do not cause post laminectomylaminotomy syndrome\\nmanagement\\nfailed back syndrome fbs is a wellrecognized complication of surgery of the lumbar spine it can result in chronic pain and disability often with disastrous emotional and financial consequences to the patient many patients have traditionally been classified as spinal cripples and are consigned to a life of longterm narcotic treatment with little chance of recovery despite extensive work in recent years fbs remains a challenging and costly disorder\\nopioids\\na study of chronic pain patients from the university of wisconsin found that methadone is most widely known for its use in the treatment of opioid dependence but methadone also provides effective analgesia patients who experience inadequate pain relief or intolerable side effects with other opioids or who suffer from neuropathic pain may benefit from a transition to methadone as their analgesic agent adverse effects particularly respiratory depression and death make a fundamental knowledge of methadones pharmacological properties essential to the provider considering methadone as analgesic therapy for a patient with chronic pain\\npatient selection\\npatients who have sciatic pain pain in the back radiating down the buttock to the leg and clear clinical findings of an identifiable radicular nerve loss caused by a herniated disc will have a better post operative course than those who simply have low back pain if a specific disc herniation causing pressure on a nerve root cannot be identified the results of surgery are likely to be disappointing patients involved in workers compensation tort litigation or other compensation systems tend to fare more poorly after surgery surgery for spinal stenosis usually has a good outcome if the surgery is done in an extensive manner and done within the first year or so of the appearance of symptoms\\noaklander and north define the failed back syndrome as a chronic pain patient after one or more surgical procedure to the spine they delineated these characteristics of the relation between the patient and the surgeon \\nin the absence of a financial source for disability or workers compensation other psychological features may limit the ability of the patient to recover from surgery some patients are simply unfortunate and fall into the category of chronic pain despite their desire to recover and the best efforts of the physicians involved in their care even less invasive forms of surgery are not uniformly successful approximately 3000040000 laminectomy patients obtain either no relief of symptomatology or a recurrence of symptoms another less invasive form of spinal surgery percutaneous disc surgery has reported revision rates as high as 65 it is no surprise therefore that fbss is a significant medical concern which merits further research and attention by the medical and surgical communities\\ntotal disc replacement\\nlumbar total disc replacement was originally designed to be an alternative to lumbar arthrodesis fusion the procedure was met with great excitement and heightened expectations both in the united states and europe in late 2004 the first lumbar total disc replacement received approval from the us food and drug administration fda more experience existed in europe since then the initial excitement has given way to skepticism and concern various failure rates and strategies for revision of total disc replacement have been reported\\nthe role of artificial or total disc replacement in the treatment of spinal disorders remains illdefined and unclear evaluation of any new technique is difficult or impossible because physician experience may be minimal or lacking patient expectations may be distorted it has been difficult to establish clear cut indications for artificial disc replacement it may not be a replacement procedure or alternative to fusion since recent studies have shown that 100 of fusion patients had one or more contraindications to disc replacement the role of disc replacement must come from new indications not defined in todays literature or a relaxation of current contraindications\\na study by regan found the result of replacement was the same at l45 and l5s1 with the charite disc however the prodisc ii had more favorable results at l45 compared with l5s1\\na younger age was predictive of a better outcome in several studies in others it has been found to be a negative predictor or of no predictive value older patients may have more complications\\nprior spinal surgery has mixed effects on disc replacement it has been reported to be negative in several studies it has been reported to have no effect in other studies many studies are simply inconclusive existing evidence does not allow drawing definite conclusions about the status of disc replacement at present\\nelectrical stimulation\\nmany failed back patients are significantly impaired by chronic pain in the back and legs many of these will be treated with some form of electrical stimulation this can be either a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device placed on the skin over the back or a nerve stimulator implanted into the back with electrical probes which directly touch the spinal cord also some chronic pain patients utilize fentanyl or narcotic patches these patients are generally severely impaired and it is unrealistic to conclude that application of neurostimulation will reduce that impairment for example it is doubtful that neurostimulation will improve the patient enough to return to competitive employment neurostimulation is palliative tens units work by blocking neurotransmission as described by the pain theory of melzack and wall success rates for implanted neurostimulation has been reported to be 25 to 55 success is defined as a relative decrease in pain\\nchiropractic\\nlimited case series have shown improvement for patients with failed back surgery who were managed with chiropractic care\\nprognosis\\nunder rules promulgated by titles ii and xvi of the united states social security act chronic radiculopathy arachnoiditis and spinal stenosis are recognized as disabling conditions under listing 104 a radiculopathy 104 b arachnoiditis and 104 c spinal stenosis \\nreturn to work\\nin a groundbreaking canadian study waddell et al reported on the value of repeat surgery and the return to work in workers compensation cases they concluded that workers who undergo spinal surgery take longer to return to their jobs once two spinal surgeries are performed few if any ever return to gainful employment of any kind after two spinal surgeries most people in the workers comp system will not be made better by more surgery most will be worse after a third surgery\\nepisodes of back pain associated with on the job injuries in the workers compensation setting are usually of short duration about 10 of such episodes will not be simple and will degenerate into chronic and disabling back pain conditions even if surgery is not performed\\nit has been hypothesized that job dissatisfaction and individual perception of physical demands are associated with an increased time of recovery or an increased risk of no recovery at all individual psychological and social work factors as well as workeremployer relations are also likely to be associated with time and rates of recovery\\na finnish study of return to work in patients with spinal stenosis treated by surgery found that 1 none of the patients who had retired before the operation returned to work afterward 2 the variables that predicted postoperative ability to work for women were being fit to work at the time of operation age lt 50 years at the time of operation and duration of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms lt 2 years 3 for men these variables were being fit to work at the time of operation age lt 50 years at the time of operation no prior surgery and the extent of the surgical procedure equal to or less than one laminectomy womens and mens working capacity do not differ after lumbar spinal stenosis operation if the aim is to maximize working capacity then when a lumbar spinal stenosis operation is indicated it should be performed without delay in lumbar spinal stenosis patients who are gt 50 years old and on sick leave it is unrealistic to expect that they will return to work therefore after such an extensive surgical procedure reeducation of patients for lighter jobs could improve the chances of these patients returning to work\\nin a related finnish study a total of 439 patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis during the period 19741987 was reexamined and evaluated for working and functional capacity approximately 4 years after the decompressive surgery the ability to work before or after the operation and a history of no prior back surgery were variables predictive of a good outcome before the operation 86 patients were working 223 patients were on sick leave and 130 patients were retired after the operation 52 of the employed patients and 70 of the unemployed patients returned to work none of the retired patients returned to work ability to work preoperatively age under 50 years at the time of operation and the absence of prior back surgery predicted a postoperative ability to work\\na report from belgium noted that patients reportedly return to work an average of 12 to 16 weeks after surgery for lumbar disc herniation however there are studies that lend credence to the value of an earlier stimulation for return to work and performance of normal activities after a limited discectomy at followup assessment it was found that no patient had changed employment because of back or leg pain\\nthe sooner the recommendation is made to return to work and perform normal activities the more likely the patient is to comply patients with ongoing disabling back conditions have a low priority for return to work the probability of return to work decreases as time off work increases this is especially true in belgium where 20 of individuals did not resume work activities after surgery for a disc herniation of the lumbar spine\\nin belgium the medical advisers of sickness funds have an important role legally in the assessment of working capacity and medical rehabilitation measures for employees whose fitness for work is jeopardized or diminished for health reasons the measures are laid down in the sickness and invalidity legislation they are in accordance with the principle of preventing longterm disability it is apparent from the authors experience that these measures are not adapted consistently in medical practice most of the medical advisers are focusing purely on evaluation of corporal damage leaving little or no time for rehabilitation efforts in many other countries the evaluation of work capacity is done by social security doctors with a comparable task\\nin a comprehensive set of studies carried out by the university of washington school of medicine it was determined that the outcome of lumbar fusion performed on injured workers was worse than reported in most published case series they found 68 of lumbar fusion patients still unable to return to work two years after surgery this was in stark contrast to reports of 68 postop satisfaction in many series in a followup study it was found that the use of intervertebral fusion devices rose rapidly after their introduction in 1996 this increase in metal usage was associated with a greater risk of complication without improving disability or reoperation rates\\nresearch\\nthe identification of tumor necrosis factoralpha tnf as a central cause of inflammatory spinal pain now suggests the possibility of an entirely new approach to selected patients with fbss specific and potent inhibitors of tnf became available in the us in 1998 and were demonstrated to be potentially effective for treating sciatica in experimental models beginning in 2001 targeted anatomic administration of one of these antitnf agents etanercept a patented treatment method has been suggested in published pilot studies to be effective for treating selected patients with chronic discrelated pain and fbss the scientific basis for pain relief in these patients is supported by the many current review articles in the future new imaging methods may allow noninvasive identification of sites of neuronal inflammation thereby enabling more accurate localization of the pain generators responsible for symptom production these treatments are still experimental\\nif chronic pain in fbss has a chemical component producing inflammatory pain then prior to additional surgery it may make sense to use an antiinflammatory approach often this is first attempted with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications but the longterm use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids for patients with persistent back pain is complicated by their possible cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity and nsaids have limited value to intervene in tnfmediated processes an alternative often employed is the injection of cortisone into the spine adjacent to the suspected pain generator a technique known as epidural steroid injection although this technique began more than a decade ago for fbss the efficacy of epidural steroid injections is now generally thought to be limited to short term pain relief in selected patients only in addition epidural steroid injections in certain settings may result in serious complications fortunately there are now emerging new methods that directly target tnf these tnftargeted methods represent a highly promising new approach for patients with chronic severe spinal pain such as those with fbss ancillary approaches such as rehabilitation physical therapy antidepressants and in particular graduated exercise programs may all be useful adjuncts to antiinflammatory approaches in addition more invasive modalities such as spinal cord stimulation may offer relief for certain patients with fbss but these modalities although often referred to as minimally invasive require additional surgery and have complications of their own\\nworldwide perspective\\na report from spain noted that the investigation and development of new techniques for instrumented surgery of the spine is not free from conflicts of interest the influence of financial forces in the development of new technologies and its immediate application to spine surgery shows the relationship between the published results and the industry support authors who have developed and defended fusion techniques have also published new articles praising new spinal technologies the author calls spinal surgery the american stock and exchange and the bubble of spine surgery the scientific literature doesnt show clear evidence in the costbenefit studies of most instrumented surgical interventions of the spine compared with the conservative treatments it has not been yet demonstrated that fusion surgery and disc replacement are better options than the conservative treatment its necessary to point out that at present there are relationships between the industry and back pain and there is also an industry of the back pain nonetheless the market of the spine surgery is growing because patients are demanding solutions for their back problems the tide of scientific evidence seems to go against the spinal fusions in the degenerative disc disease discogenic pain and in specific back pain after decades of advances in this field the results of spinal fusions are mediocre new epidemiological studies show that spinal fusion must be accepted as a non proved or experimental method for the treatment of back pain the surgical literature on spinal fusion published in the last 20 years establishes that instrumentation seems to slightly increase the fusion rate and that instrumentation doesnt improve the clinical results in general we still are in need of randomized studies to compare the surgical results with the natural history of the disease the placebo effect or conservative treatment the european guidelines for lumbar chronic pain management show strong evidence indicating that complex and demanding spine surgery where different instrumentation is used is not more effective than a simple safer and cheaper posterolateral fusion without instrumentation recently the literature published in this field is sending a message to use minimally invasive techniques  the abandonment of transpedicular fusions surgery in general and usage of metal fixation should be discarded in most cases\\nin sweden the national registry of lumbar spine surgery reported in the year 2000 that 15 of patients with spinal stenosis surgery underwent a concomitant fusion despite the traditionally conservative approach to spinal surgery in sweden there have been calls from that country for a more aggressive approach to lumbar procedures in recent years\\ncherkin et al evaluated worldwide surgical attitudes there were twice the number of surgeons per capita in the united states compared to the united kingdom numbers were similar to sweden despite having very few spinal surgeons the netherlands proved to be quite aggressive in surgery sweden despite having a large number of surgeons was conservative and produced relatively few surgeries the most surgeries were done in the united states in the uk more than a third of nonurgent patients waited over a year to see a spinal surgeon in wales more than half waited over three months for consult lower rates of referrals in the united kingdom was found to discourage surgery in general fee for service and easy access to care was thought to encourage spinal surgery in the united states whereas salaried position and a conservative philosophy led to less surgery in the united kingdom there were more spinal surgeons in sweden than in the united states however it was speculated that the swedish surgeons being limited to compensation of 4048 hours a week might lead to a conservative philosophy there have been calls for a more aggressive approach to lumbar surgery in both the united kingdom and sweden in recent years'}, {'title': 'Cholera', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium vibrio cholerae symptoms may range from none to mild to severe the classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance this may result in sunken eyes cold skin decreased skin elasticity and wrinkling of the hands and feet dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure\\ncholera is caused by a number of types of vibrio cholerae with some types producing more severe disease than others it is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria undercooked seafood is a common source humans are the only known host for the bacteria risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation not enough clean drinking water and poverty cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test a rapid dipstick test is available but is not as accurate\\nprevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months they have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by e\\xa0coli the primary treatment is oral rehydration therapythe replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions ricebased solutions are preferred zinc supplementation is useful in children in severe cases intravenous fluids such as ringers lactate may be required and antibiotics may be beneficial testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice\\ncholera affects an estimated 35\\xa0million people worldwide and causes 28800130000\\xa0deaths a year although it is classified as a pandemic  it is rare in high income countries children are mostly affected cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas areas with an ongoing risk of disease include africa and southeast asia the risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5 but may be as high as 50 no access to treatment results in a higher death rate descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century bc in sanskrit the study of cholera in england by john snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology seven large outbreaks have occurred over the last 200 years with millions of deaths\\nsigns and symptoms\\nthe primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid these symptoms usually start suddenly half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria the diarrhea is frequently described as rice water in nature and may have a fishy odor an untreated person with cholera may produce of diarrhea a day severe cholera without treatment kills about half of affected individuals if the severe diarrhea is not treated it can result in lifethreatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 cholera has been nicknamed the blue death because a persons skin may turn bluishgray from extreme loss of fluids\\nfever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes dry mouth cold clammy skin or wrinkled hands and feet kussmaul breathing a deep and labored breathing pattern can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion blood pressure drops due to dehydration peripheral pulse is rapid and thready and urine output decreases with time muscle cramping and weakness altered consciousness seizures or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common especially in children\\ncause\\ntransmission\\ncholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton\\ntransmission is usually through the fecaloral route of contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food while in developing countries it is more often water food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage as vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton\\npeople infected with cholera often have diarrhea and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool colloquially referred to as ricewater contaminates water used by others a single diarrheal event can cause a onemillion fold increase in numbers of v cholerae in the environment the source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways groundwater or drinking water supplies drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway can cause a person to contract an infection cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person\\nv cholerae also exists outside the human body in natural water sources either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton zooplankton or biotic and abiotic detritus drinking such water can also result in the disease even without prior contamination through fecal matter selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of v cholerae specifically animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment this transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of v cholerae to be cultured on standard media a phenotype referred to as viable but nonculturable vbnc or more conservatively active but nonculturable abnc one study indicates that the culturability of v cholerae drops 90 within 24 hours of entering the water and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence\\nboth toxic and nontoxic strains exist nontoxic strains can acquire toxicity through a temperate bacteriophage\\nsusceptibility\\nabout 100million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult this dose however is less in those with lowered gastric acidity for instance those using proton pump inhibitors children are also more susceptible with two to fouryearolds having the highest rates of infection individuals susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type with those with type o blood being the most susceptible persons with lowered immunity such as persons with aids or malnourished children are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected any individual even a healthy adult in middle age can experience a severe case and each persons case should be measured by the loss of fluids preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider\\nthe cystic fibrosis genetic mutation known as deltaf508 in humans has been said to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage heterozygous carriers of the mutation who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis are more resistant to v cholerae infections in this model the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium thus reducing the effects of an infection\\nmechanism\\nwhen consumed most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach the few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down protein production when the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine they must propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive\\nonce the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall they no longer need the flagella to move the bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings on reaching the intestinal wall v cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea this carries the multiplying new generations of v cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place\\nthe cholera toxin ctx or ct is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits a single copy of the a subunit part a and five copies of the b subunit part b connected by a disulfide bond the five b subunits form a fivemembered ring that binds to gm1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells the a1 portion of the a subunit is an enzyme that adpribosylates g proteins while the a2 chain fits into the central pore of the b subunit ring upon binding the complex is taken into the cell via receptormediated endocytosis once inside the cell the disulfide bond is reduced and the a1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called adpribosylation factor 6 arf6 binding exposes its active site allowing it to permanently ribosylate the gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric g protein this results in constitutive camp production which in turn leads to the secretion of water sodium potassium and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration the gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into v cholerae by horizontal gene transfer virulent strains of v cholerae carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called ctx\\nmicrobiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the v cholerae bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter passing through the stomach through the mucous layer of the small intestine and on to the intestinal wall of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell the chloride and sodium ions create a saltwater environment in the small intestines which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells creating the massive amounts of diarrhea the host can become rapidly dehydrated unless treated properly\\nby inserting separate successive sections of v cholerae dna into the dna of other bacteria such as e coli that would not naturally produce the protein toxins researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which v cholerae responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach mucous layers and intestinal wall researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of v cholerae virulence determinants in responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall the v cholerae bacteria produce the tcpptcph proteins which together with the toxrtoxs proteins activate the expression of the toxt regulatory protein toxt then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine current research aims at discovering the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize that is adhere to the cells of the small intestine\\ngenetic structure\\namplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of v cholerae has revealed variation in the genetic structure two clusters have been identified cluster i and cluster ii for the most part cluster i consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s while cluster ii largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s based on the change in the clone structure this grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the african continent\\nantibiotic resistance\\nin many areas of the world antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria in bangladesh for example most cases are resistant to tetracycline trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and erythromycin rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multidrug resistant cases new generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in in vitro studies\\ndiagnosis\\na rapid dipstick test is available to determine the presence of v cholerae in those samples that test positive further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance in epidemic situations a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis\\nstool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease before antibiotics have been administered are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis if an epidemic of cholera is suspected the most common causative agent is v cholerae o1 if v cholerae serogroup o1 is not isolated the laboratory should test for v cholerae o139 however if neither of these organisms is isolated it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory\\ninfection with v cholerae o139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by v cholerae o1 the associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the united states\\nprevention\\nthe world health organization who recommends focusing on prevention preparedness and response to combat the spread of cholera they also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system governments can play a role in all of these areas\\nwater sanitation and hygiene\\nalthough cholera may be lifethreatening prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed in developed countries due to nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices present there cholera is rare for example the last major outbreak of cholera in the united states occurred in 19101911 cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to wash water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure is still inadequate\\neffective sanitation practices if instituted and adhered to in time are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic there are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted\\nhandwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by who africa\\nsurveillance\\nsurveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable for prevention to be effective it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities\\nvaccination\\nspanish physician jaume ferran i clua developed a cholera inoculation in 1885 the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease however his vaccine and inoculation was rather controversial and was rejected by his peers and several investigation commissions russianjewish bacteriologist waldemar haffkine successfully developed the first human cholera vaccine in july 1892 he conducted a massive inoculation program in british india\\na number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available the world health organization who has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines ocvs dukoral sanchol and euvichol dukoral an orally administered inactivated whole cell vaccine has an overall efficacy of about 52 during the first year after being given and 62 in the second year with minimal side effects it is available in over 60 countries however it is not currently recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for most people traveling from the united states to endemic countries the vaccine that the us food and drug administration fda recommends vaxchora is an oral attenuated live vaccine that is effective as a single dose\\none injectable vaccine was found to be effective for two to three years the protective efficacy was 28 lower in children less than five years old however  it has limited availability work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination the who recommends immunization of highrisk groups such as children and people with hiv in countries where this disease is endemic if people are immunized broadly herd immunity results with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment\\nwho recommends that oral cholera vaccination be considered in areas where the disease is endemic with seasonal peaks as part of the response to outbreaks or in a humanitarian crisis during which the risk of cholera is high oral cholera vaccine ocv has been recognized as an adjunct tool for prevention and control of cholera the world health organization who has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccinesdukoral sbl vaccines containing a nontoxic bsubunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against v cholerae o1 and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technologyshanchol shantha biotec and euvichol eubiologics co which have bivalent o1 and o139 oral killed cholera vaccines oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from choleraendemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises but no clear consensus exists\\nsari filtration\\ndeveloped for use in bangladesh the sari filter is a simple and costeffective appropriate technology method for reducing the contamination of drinking water used sari cloth is preferable but other types of used cloth can be used with some effect though the effectiveness will vary significantly used cloth is more effective than new cloth as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibers water collected in this way has a greatly reduced pathogen countthough it will not necessarily be perfectly safe it is an improvement for poor people with limited options in bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half it involves folding a sari four to eight times between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it a nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable\\ntreatment\\ncontinued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function the who recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause a cdc training manual specifically for cholera states continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea even when traveling to get treatment adults and older children should continue to eat frequently\\nfluids\\nthe most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed\\nand volume of fluids required in most cases cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy ort which is highly effective safe and simple to administer ricebased solutions are preferred to glucosebased ones due to greater efficiency in severe cases with significant dehydration intravenous rehydration may be necessary ringers lactate is the preferred solution often with added potassium large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed ten percent of a persons body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours this method was first tried on a mass scale during the bangladesh liberation war and was found to have much success despite widespread beliefs fruit juices and commercial fizzy drinks like cola are not ideal for rehydration of people with serious infections of the intestines and their excessive sugar content may even harm water uptake\\nif commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain solutions can be made one such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water 12 teaspoon of salt 6 teaspoons of sugar and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste\\nelectrolytes\\nas there frequently is initially acidosis the potassium level may be normal even though large losses have occurred as the dehydration is corrected potassium levels may decrease rapidly and thus need to be replaced this may be done by consuming foods high in potassium like bananas or coconut water\\nantibiotics\\nantibiotic treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms use of antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements people will recover without them however if sufficient hydration is maintained the who only recommends antibiotics in those with severe dehydration\\ndoxycycline is typically used first line although some strains of v cholerae have shown resistance testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices other antibiotics proven to be effective include cotrimoxazole erythromycin tetracycline chloramphenicol and furazolidone fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin also may be used but resistance has been reported\\nantibiotics improve outcomes in those who are both severely and not severely dehydrated azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin\\nzinc supplementation\\nin bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and rehydration therapy as needed it reduced the length of disease by eight hours and the amount of diarrhea stool by 10 supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world\\nprognosis\\nif people with cholera are treated quickly and properly the mortality rate is less than 1 however with untreated cholera the mortality rate rises to 5060\\nfor certain genetic strains of cholera such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in haiti and the 2004 outbreak in india death can occur within two hours of becoming ill\\nepidemiology\\ncholera affects an estimated 28\\xa0million people worldwide and causes approximately 95000\\xa0deaths a year uncertainty range 21000143000  this occurs mainly in the developing world in the early 1980s death rates are believed to have been greater than three million a year it is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country cholera remains both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world in october 2016 an outbreak of cholera began in warravaged yemen who called it the worst cholera outbreak in the world\\nrecent major outbreaks are the 2010s haiti cholera outbreak and the 20162021 yemen cholera outbreak in 2019 93 of the reported 923037 cholera cases were from yemen with 1911 deaths reported between september 2019 and september 2020 a global total of over 450000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported however these numbers suffer from overreporting from countries that report suspected cases and not laboratory confirmed cases as well as underreporting from countries that do not report official cases such as bangladesh india and philippines\\nalthough much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread but bodies of water can serve as a reservoir and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease\\ncholera was not known in the americas for most of the 20th century but it reappeared towards the end of that century after the end of the 2010s haiti cholera outbreak there have not been any cholera cases in the americas since february 2019 the disease is endemic in africa and some areas of asia bangladesh india and yemen cholera is not endemic in europe all reported cases had a travel history to endemic areas\\nhistory of outbreaks\\nthe word cholera is from kholera from  khol bile cholera likely has its origins in the indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries\\nthe disease appears in the european literature as early as 1642 from the dutch physician jakob de bondts description it in his de medicina indorum the indorum of the title refers to the east indies he also gave first european descriptions of other diseases\\nearly outbreaks in the indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive the disease first spread by trade routes land and sea to russia in 1817 later to the rest of europe and from europe to north america and the rest of the world hence the name asiatic cholera seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years with the seventh pandemic originating in indonesia in 1961\\nthe first cholera pandemic occurred in the bengal region of india near calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824 the disease dispersed from india to southeast asia the middle east europe and eastern africa the movement of british army and navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the indian ocean from africa to indonesia and north to china and japan the second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected north america and europe due to the result of advancements in transportation and global trade and increased human migration including soldiers the third pandemic erupted in 1846 persisted until 1860 extended to north africa and reached south america for the first time specifically affecting brazil the fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875 spread from india to naples and spain the fifth pandemic was from 18811896 and started in india and spread to europe asia and south america the sixth pandemic started 18991923 these epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria egypt the arabian peninsula persia india and the philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics while other areas like germany in 1892 primarily the city of hamburg where more than 8600 people died and naples from 19101911 also experienced severe outbreaks the seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain nicknamed el tor which still persists  in developing countries\\ncholera became widespread in the 19th century since then it has killed tens of millions of people in russia alone between 1847 and 1851 more than one million people perished of the disease it killed 150000 americans during the second pandemic between 1900 and 1920 perhaps eight million people died of cholera in india cholera became the first reportable disease in the united states due to the significant effects it had on health john snow in england was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854 cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in europe and north america due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies but still heavily affects populations in developing countries\\nin the past vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers were suffering from cholera no one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period typically 30 to 40 days\\nhistorically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore many of the older remedies were based on the miasma theory some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible and flannel and cholera belts were routine in army kits in the 18541855 outbreak in naples homeopathic camphor was used according to hahnemann t j ritters mothers remedies book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern america elecampane was recommended in the united kingdom according to william thomas fernie the first effective human vaccine was developed in 1885 and the first effective antibiotic was developed in 1948\\ncholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments the united states for example used to have a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries there were three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s which can be attributed to vibrio choleraes spread through interior waterways like the erie canal and routes along the eastern seaboard the island of manhattan in new york city touched the atlantic ocean where cholera collected just off the coast at this time new york city did not have as effective a sanitation system as it does today so cholera was able to spread\\ncholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera\\nresearch\\none of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist john snow 18131858 who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water dr snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849 in his major state of the art review of 1855 he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease in two pioneering epidemiological field studies he was able to demonstrate human sewage contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in london in 1854 his model was not immediately accepted but it was seen to be the more plausible as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so for his work on cholera john snow is often regarded as the father of epidemiology\\nthe bacterium was isolated in 1854 by italian anatomist filippo pacini but its exact nature and his results were not widely known in the same year the catalan joaquim balcells i pascual discovered the bacterium and in 1856 probably antnio augusto da costa simes and jos ferreira de macedo pinto two portuguese men did the same\\ncities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and wellseparated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid1850s and the 1900s this eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world in 1883 robert koch identified v cholerae with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease\\nhemendra nath chatterjee a bengali scientist who first formulated and demonstrated the effectiveness of oral rehydration salt ors for diarrhea in his 1953 paper published in the lancet he states that promethazine can stop vomiting during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible the formulation of the fluid replacement solution was 4\\xa0g of sodium chloride 25\\xa0g of glucose and 1000\\xa0ml of water\\nindian medical scientist sambhu nath de discovered the cholera toxin the animal model of cholera and successfully demonstrate the method of transmission of cholera pathogen vibrio cholerae\\nrobert allan phillips working at the us naval medical research unit two in southeast asia evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration his research led the lasker foundation to award him its prize in 1967\\nmore recently in 2002 alam et al studied stool samples from patients at the international centre for diarrhoeal disease in dhaka bangladesh from the various experiments they conducted the researchers found a correlation between the passage of v cholerae through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state furthermore the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where genes that control biosynthesis of amino acids iron uptake systems and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation these induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the rice water stools an environment of limited oxygen and iron of patients with a cholera infection\\nglobal strategy\\nin 2017 the who launched the ending cholera a global roadmap to 2030 strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90 by 2030 the strategy was developed by the global task force on cholera control gtfcc which develops countryspecific plans and monitors progress the approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance water sanitation treatment and oral vaccines specifically the control strategy focusses on three approaches i early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks ii stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots and iii a global framework for cholera control through the gtfcc\\nthe who and the gtfcc do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal even though humans are the only host of cholera the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host while global eradication is not possible elimination of human to human transmission may be possible and local elimination is possible most recently during the 2010s haiti cholera outbreak which aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022\\nthe gtfcc targets 47 countries 13 of which have established vaccination campaigns\\nsociety and culture\\nhealth policy\\nin many developing countries cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease governments can play a role in this in 2008 for example the zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the governments role according to a report from the james baker institute the haitian governments inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well\\nsimilarly south africas cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the governments policy of privatizing water programs the wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholerainfected rivers\\naccording to rita r colwell of the james baker institute if cholera does begin to spread government preparedness is crucial a governments ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately oftentimes this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of vibrio cholerae specimens having an effective surveillance program contributes to a governments ability to prevent cholera from spreading in the year 2000 in the state of kerala in india the kottayam district was determined to be choleraaffected this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13670 information sessions about human health these task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts ultimately this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths on the other hand researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in bangladesh lived in rural areas and were not recognized by the governments surveillance program this inhibited physicians abilities to detect cholera cases early\\naccording to colwell the quality and inclusiveness of a countrys health care system affects the control of cholera as it did in the zimbabwean cholera outbreak while sanitation practices are important when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines the country will have a lower cholera death toll affordability of vaccines can be a problem if the governments do not provide vaccinations only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the countrys poor the speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important\\nbesides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera a countrys government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread a speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent choleras spread this limits choleras ability to cause death or at the very least a decline in education as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection\\nin popular culture\\nunlike tuberculosis consumption which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the lowerclasses living in filth and poverty this and the unpleasant course of the disease  which includes voluminous ricewater diarrhea the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death  has discouraged the disease from being romanticized or even the actual factual presentation of the disease in popular culture\\ncountry examples\\nzambia\\nin zambia widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977 most commonly in the capital city of lusaka in 2017 an outbreak of cholera was declared in zambia after laboratory confirmation of vibrio cholerae o1 biotype el tor serotype ogawa from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea there was a rapid increase in the number of cases from several hundred cases in early december 2017 to approximately 2000 by early january 2018 with intensification of the rains new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of january 2018 with over 700 cases reported\\nin collaboration with partners the zambia ministry of health moh launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the lusaka municipal water supply provision of emergency water supplies water quality monitoring and testing enhanced surveillance epidemiologic investigations a cholera vaccination campaign aggressive case management and health care worker training and laboratory testing of clinical samples\\nthe zambian ministry of health implemented a reactive onedose oral cholera vaccine ocv campaign in april 2016 in three lusaka compounds followed by a preemptive secondround in december\\nindia\\nin the city of kolkata india in the state of west bengal in the ganges delta has been described as the homeland of cholera with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality in india where the disease is endemic cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons india is also characterized by high population density unsafe drinking water open drains and poor sanitation which provide an optimal niche for survival sustenance and transmission of vibrio cholerae\\ndemocratic republic of congo\\nin goma in the democratic republic of congo cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology basic membrane biology and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design'}, {'title': 'Rectal_prolapse', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'rectal prolapse is when the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body however most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally and if the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved\\nrectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge mucus coming from the anus rectal bleeding degrees of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation symptoms\\nrectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women although it may occur at any age and in either sex it is very rarely lifethreatening but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated most external prolapse cases can be treated successfully often with a surgical procedure internal prolapses are traditionally harder to treat and surgery may not be suitable for many patients \\nclassification\\nthe different kinds of rectal prolapse can be difficult to grasp as different definitions are used and some recognize some subtypes and others do not essentially rectal prolapses may be\\nexternal complete rectal prolapse rectal procidentia full thickness rectal prolapse external rectal prolapse is\\na full thickness circumferential true intussusception of the rectal wall which protrudes from the anus and is visible externally\\ninternal rectal intussusception occult rectal prolapse internal procidentia can be defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal or lower sigmoid wall that can occur during defecation this infolding is perhaps best visualised as folding a sock inside out creating a tube within a tube another definition is where the rectum collapses but does not exit the anus many sources differentiate between internal rectal intussusception and mucosal prolapse implying that the former is a full thickness prolapse of rectal wall however a publication by the american society of colon and rectal surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the mucosal and submucosal layers separating from the underlying muscularis mucosa layer attachments resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining sliding down this may signify that authors use the terms internal rectal prolapse and internal mucosal prolapse to describe the same phenomena\\nmucosal prolapse partial rectal mucosal prolapse refers to prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal layer of the rectal wall most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed 3rd or 4th degree hemorrhoids piles however both internal mucosal prolapse see below and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse\\ninternal mucosal prolapse rectal internal mucosal prolapse rimp refers to prolapse of the mucosal layer of the rectal wall which does not protrude externally there is some controversy surrounding this condition as to its relationship with hemorrhoidal disease or whether it is a separate entity the term mucosal hemorrhoidal prolapse is also used\\nsolitary rectal ulcer syndrome srus solitary rectal ulcer sru occurs with internal rectal intussusception and is part of the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions it describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining srus can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception which can be demonstrated in 94 of cases\\nmucosal prolapse syndrome mps is recognized by some it includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome rectal prolapse proctitis cystica profunda and inflammatory polyps it is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder\\nrectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception has been classified according to the size of the prolapsed section of rectum a function of rectal mobility from the sacrum and infolding of the rectum this classification also takes into account sphincter relaxation \\nrectal internal mucosal prolapse has been graded according to the level of descent of the intussusceptum which was predictive of symptom severity \\nthe most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectalsigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the anal canal the height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by defecography\\nrectorectal high intussusception intrarectal intussusception is where the intussusception starts in the rectum does not protrude into the anal canal but stays within the rectum ie the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal the intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only these are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower sigmoid\\nrectoanal low intussusception intraanal intussusception is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal ie the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal\\nan anatomicofunctional classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology the parameters of this classification are anatomic descent diameter of intussuscepted bowel associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit\\ndiagnosis\\nhistory\\npatients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management history of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management\\nphysical examination\\nrectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing 3rd or 4th degree hemorrhoids where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3 7 and 11 oclock positions mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse a complete rectal prolapse by the orientation of the folds furrows in the prolapsed section in full thickness rectal prolapse these folds run circumferential in mucosal prolapse these folds are radially the folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids furthermore in rectal prolapse there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus prolapsed incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated it gives little pain and is easy to reduce\\nthe prolapse may be obvious or it may require straining and squatting to produce it the anus is usually patulous loose open and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet a phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining\\nthe perianal skin may be macerated softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet and show excoriation\\nproctoscopysigmoidoscopycolonoscopy\\nthese may reveal congestion and edema swelling of the distal rectal mucosa and in 1015 of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied and may lead to a diagnosis of srus or colitis cystica profunda rarely a neoplasm tumour may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum in addition patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention these investigations may be used with contrast media barium enema which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities\\nvideodefecography\\nthis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination it is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse defecography may demonstrate associated conditions like cystocele vaginal vault prolapse or enterocele\\ncolonic transit studies\\ncolonic transit studies may be used to rule out colonic inertia if there is a history of severe constipation continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy\\nanorectal manometry\\nthis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters however the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some it may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries eg starr and these patients may benefit from postoperative biofeedback therapy decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings and this may predate the development of the prolapse resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse in patients with reduced resting pressure levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence\\nanal electromyographypudendal nerve testing\\nit may be used to evaluate incontinence but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan there may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram increased nerve conduction periods nerve damage this may be significant in predicting postoperative incontinence\\ncomplete rectal prolapse\\nrectal prolapse is a falling down of the rectum so that it is visible externally the appearance is of a reddened proboscislike object through the anal sphincters patients find the condition embarrassing the symptoms can be socially debilitating without treatment but it is rarely lifethreatening\\nthe true incidence of rectal prolapse is unknown but it is thought to be uncommon as most sufferers are elderly the condition is generally underreported it may occur at any age even in children but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men it is rare in men over 45 and in women under 20 when males are affected they tend to be young and report significant bowel function symptoms especially obstructed defecation or have a predisposing disorder eg congenital anal atresia when children are affected they are usually under the age of 3\\n35 of women with rectal prolapse have never had children suggesting that pregnancy and labour are not significant factors anatomical differences such as the wider pelvic outlet in females may explain the skewed gender distribution\\nassociated conditions especially in younger patients include autism developmental delay syndromes and psychiatric conditions requiring several medications\\nsigns and symptoms\\nsigns and symptoms include\\ninitially the mass may protrude through the anal canal only during defecation and straining and spontaneously return afterwards later the mass may have to be pushed back in following defecation this may progress to a chronically prolapsed and severe condition defined as spontaneous prolapse that is difficult to keep inside and occurs with walking prolonged standing coughing or sneezing valsalva maneuvers a chronically prolapsed rectal tissue may undergo pathological changes such as thickening ulceration and bleeding\\nif the prolapse becomes trapped externally outside the anal sphincters it may become strangulated and there is a risk of perforation this may require an urgent surgical operation if the prolapse cannot be manually reduced applying granulated sugar on the exposed rectal tissue can reduce the edema swelling and facilitate this\\ncause\\nthe precise cause is unknown and has been much debated in 1912 moschcowitz proposed that rectal prolapse was a sliding hernia through a pelvic fascial defect\\nthis theory was based on the observation that rectal prolapse patients have a mobile and unsupported pelvic floor and a hernia sac of peritoneum from the pouch of douglas and rectal wall can be seen other adjacent structures can sometimes be seen in addition to the rectal prolapse although a pouch of douglas hernia originating in the cul de sac of douglas may protrude from the anus via the anterior rectal wall this is a different situation from rectal prolapse\\nshortly after the invention of defecography in 1968 broden and snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum which slowly increases over time the leading edge of the intussusceptum may be located at 68\\xa0cm or at 1518\\xa0cm from the anal verge this proved an older theory from the 18th century by john hunter and albrecht von haller that this condition is essentially a fullthickness rectal intussusception beginning about 3 inches above the dentate line and protruding externally\\nsince most patients with rectal prolapse have a long history of constipation it is thought that prolonged excessive and repetitive straining during defecation may predispose to rectal prolapse since rectal prolapse itself causes functional obstruction more straining may result from a small prolapse with increasing damage to the anatomy this excessive straining may be due to predisposing pelvic floor dysfunction eg obstructed defecation and anatomical factors\\nsome authors question whether these abnormalities are the cause or secondary to the prolapse other predisposing factorsassociated conditions include \\nthe association with uterine prolapse 1025 and cystocele 35 may suggest that there is some underlying abnormality of the pelvic floor that affects multiple pelvic organs proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence this finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects and may be the cause of denervationrelated atrophy of the external anal sphincter some authors suggest that pudendal nerve damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders\\nsphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced this may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum alternatively the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex rair  contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum the rair was shown to be absent or blunted squeeze maximum voluntary contraction pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone this is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter\\nthe assumed mechanism of fecal incontinence in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit the intussusceptum connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters\\nthe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canals ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents the intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal lumen creating a blockage that straining anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate\\nsome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse the intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception however internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse the factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40 of asymptomatic subjects raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some and may predispose patients to develop symptoms or exacerbate other problems\\ntreatment\\nconservative\\nsurgery is thought to be the only option to potentially cure a complete rectal prolapse for people with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery and those who have minimal symptoms conservative measures may be beneficial dietary adjustments including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation and thereby reduce straining a bulk forming agent eg psyllium or stool softener can also reduce constipation\\nsurgical\\nsurgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters the goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms there is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective and there have been over 50 different operations described\\nsurgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal a perineal approach or transperineal refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via an incision around the anus and perineum the area between the genitals and the anus abdominal approach transabdominal approach involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the pelvic cavity procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel rectopexy or resection a portion removed or both transanal endoanal procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself\\nabdominal procedures\\nthe abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males eg 12 in abdominal rectopexy abdominal operations may be open or laparoscopic keyhole surgery\\nlaparoscopic procedures\\nrecovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision laparotomy a laparoscope a thin lighted tube and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results\\nperineal procedures\\nthe perineal approach generally results in less postoperative pain and complications and a reduced length of hospital stay these procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome the perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and delorme repair elderly or other medically highrisk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures as they can be performed under a regional anesthetic or even local anesthetic with intravenous sedation thus avoid the risks of a general anesthetic alternatively perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern\\nperineal rectosigmoidectomy\\nthe goal of perineal rectosigmoidectomy is to resect or remove the redundant bowel this is done through the perineum the lower rectum is anchored to the sacrum through fibrosis in order to prevent future prolapse the full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected anastomosed with the anal canal with stitches or staples this procedure may be combined with levatorplasty to tighten the pelvic muscles a combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatorplasty is also called an altemeier procedure levatorplasty is performed to correct levator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by mikulicz in 1899 and it remained the preferred treatment in europe for many years it was popularized by altemeier the procedure is simple safe and effective continence levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence 23 of patients complications occur in less than 10 of cases and include pelvic bleeding pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence splitting apart of the stitches inside bleeding or leak at a dehiscence mortality is low recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair 1630 but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates additional levatorplasty can reduce recurrence rates to 7\\ndelorme procedure\\nthis is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment rather than full thickness resection the prolapse is exposed if it is not already present and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel the muscle layer that is left is plicated folded and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor the edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together mucosal proctectomy was first discussed by delorme in 1900 now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision while effectively repairing the prolapse the procedure is ideally suited to those patients with fullthickness prolapse limited to partial circumference eg anterior wall or lessextensive prolapse perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation fecal incontinence is improved following surgery 4075 of patients post operatively both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased constipation is improved in 50 of cases but often urgency and tenesmus are created complications including infection urinary retention bleeding anastomotic dehiscence opening of the stitched edges inside stricture narrowing of the gut lumen diarrhea and fecal impaction occur in 632 of cases mortality occurs in 025 cases there is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches 726 cases\\nanal encirclement thirsch procedure\\nthis procedure can be carried out under local anaesthetic after reduction of the prolapse a subcutaneous suture a stich under the skin or other material is placed encircling the anus which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse placing silver wire around the anus first described by thiersch in 1891 materials used include nylon silk silastic rods silicone marlex mesh mersilene mesh fascia tendon and dacron this operation does not correct the prolapse itself it merely supplements the anal sphincter narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external meaning it remains in the rectum this goal is achieved in 54100 cases complications include breakage of the encirclement material fecal impaction sepsis and erosion into the skin or anal canal recurrence rates are higher than the other perineal procedures this procedure is most often used for people who have a severe condition or who have a high risk of adverse effects from general anesthetic and who may not tolerate other perineal procedures\\ninternal rectal intussusception\\ninternal rectal intussusception rectal intussusception internal intussusception internal rectal prolapse occult rectal prolapse internal rectal procidentia and rectal invagination is a medical condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the rectal wall that can occur during defecation\\nthis phenomenon was first described in the late 1960s when defecography was first developed and became widespread degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40 of asymptomatic subjects raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some and may predispose patients to develop symptoms or exacerbate other problems\\nsymptoms\\ninternal intussusception may be asymptomatic but common symptoms include\\nrectorectal intussusceptions may be asymptomatic apart from mild obstructed defecation interrupted defaecation in the morning is thought by some to be characteristic\\nrectoanal intussusceptions commonly give more severe symptoms of straining incomplete evacuation need for digital evacuation of stool need for support of the perineum during defecation urgency frequency or intermittent fecal incontinence\\nit has been observed that intussusceptions of thickness 3\\xa0mm and those that appear to cause obstruction to rectal evacuation may give clinical symptoms\\ncause\\nthere are two schools of thought regarding the nature of internal intussusception viz whether it is a primary phenomenon or secondary to a consequence of another condition\\nsome believe that it represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse the intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception the folding section of rectum can cause repeated trauma to the mucosa and can cause solitary rectal ulcer syndrome however internal intussusception rarely progress to external rectal prolapse\\nothers argue that the majority of patients appear to have rectal intussusception as a consequence of obstructed defecation rather than a cause possibly related to excessive straining in patients with obstructed defecation patients with other causes of obstructed defecation outlet obstruction like anismus also tend to have higher incidence of internal intussusception enteroceles are coexistent in 11 of patients with internal intussusception symptoms of internal intussusception overlap with those of rectocele indeed the 2 conditions can occur together\\npatients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome combined with internal intussusception as 94 of srus patients have were shown to have altered rectal wall biomechanics compared to patients with internal intussusception alone the presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum occluding the rectal lumen during attempted defecation one study analysed resected rectal wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception undergoing stapled transanal rectal resection they reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors one study concluded that intussusception of the anterior rectal wall shares the same cause as rectocele namely deficient rectovaginal ligamentous support\\ncomorbidities and complications\\nthe following conditions occur more commonly in patients with internal rectal intussusception than in the general population\\ndiagnosis\\nunlike external rectal prolapse internal rectal intussusception is not visible externally but it may still be diagnosed by digital rectal examination while the patient strains as if to defecate imaging such as a defecating proctogram or dynamic mri defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the rectal wall some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing anorectal manometry\\ntreatment\\nnon surgical measures to treat internal intussusception include pelvic floor retraining a bulking agent eg psyllium suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining if there is incontinence fecal leakage or more severe fi or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor anismus then biofeedback retraining is indicated some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery\\nas with external rectal prolapse there are a great many different surgical interventions described generally a section of rectal wall can be resected removed or the rectum can be fixed rectopexy to its original position against the sacral vertebrae or a combination of both methods surgery for internal rectal prolapse can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach\\nit is clear that there is a wide spectrum of symptom severity meaning that some patients may benefit from surgery and others may not many procedures receive conflicting reports of success leading to a lack of any consensus about the best way to manage this problem relapse of the intussusception after treatment is a problem two of the most commonly employed procedures are discussed below\\nlaparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy lvr\\nthis procedure aims to correct the descent of the posterior and middle pelvic compartments combined with reinforcement of the rectovaginal septum\\nrectopexy has been shown to improve anal incontinence fecal leakage in patients with rectal intussusception the operation has been shown to have low recurrence rate around 5 it also improves obstructed defecation symptoms\\ncomplications include constipation which is reduced if the technique does not use posterior rectal mobilization freeing the rectum from its attached back surface\\nthe advantage of the laproscopic approach is decreased healing time and less complications\\nstapled transanal rectal resection starr\\nthis operation aims to remove the anorectal mucosa circumferential and reinforce the anterior anorectal junction wall with the use of a circular stapler in contrast to other methods starr does not correct the descent of the rectum it removes the redundant tissue the technique was developed from a similar stapling procedure for prolapsing hemorrhoids since specialized circular staplers have been developed for use in external rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception\\ncomplications sometimes serious have been reported following starr but the procedure is now considered safe and effective starr is contraindicated in patients with weak sphincters fecal incontinence and urgency are a possible complication and with anismus paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor during attempted defecation the operation has been shown to improve rectal sensitivity and decrease rectal volume the reason thought to create urgency 90 of patients do not report urgency 12 months after the operation the anal sphincter may also be stretched during the operation starr was compared with biofeedback and found to be more effective at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life\\nmucosal prolapse\\nrectal mucosal prolapse mucosal prolapse anal mucosal prolapse is a subtype of rectal prolapse and refers to abnormal descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus it is different to an internal intussusception occult prolapse or a complete rectal prolapse external prolapse procidentia because these conditions involve the full thickness of the rectal wall rather than only the mucosa lining\\nmucosal prolapse is a different condition to prolapsing 3rd or 4th degree hemorrhoids although they may look similar\\nrectal mucosal prolapse can be a cause of obstructed defecation outlet obstruction and rectal malodor\\nsymptoms\\nsymptom severity increases with the size of the prolapse and whether it spontaneously reduces after defecation requires manual reduction by the patient or becomes irreducible the symptoms are identical to advanced hemorrhoidal disease and include\\ncause\\nthe condition along with complete rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception is thought to be related to chronic straining during defecation and constipation\\nmucosal prolapse occurs when the results from loosening of the submucosal attachments between the mucosal layer and the muscularis propria of the distal rectum the section of prolapsed rectal mucosa can become ulcerated leading to bleeding\\ndiagnosis\\nmucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse a complete rectal prolapse by the orientation of the folds furrows in the prolapsed section in full thickness rectal prolapse these folds run circumferential in mucosal prolapse these folds are radially the folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids\\ntreatment\\n examination under anesthesia of anorectum and banding of the mucosa with rubber bands\\nsolitary rectal ulcer syndrome and colitis cystica profunda\\nsolitary rectal ulcer syndrome srus sru is a disorder of the rectum and anal canal caused by straining and increased pressure during defecation this increased pressure causes the anterior portion of the rectal lining to be forced into the anal canal an internal rectal intussusception the lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction resulting in ulceration srus can therefore be considered to be a consequence of internal intussusception a sub type of rectal prolapse which can be demonstrated in 94 of cases it may be asymptomatic but it can cause rectal pain rectal bleeding rectal malodor incomplete evacuation and obstructed defecation rectal outlet obstruction\\nsymptoms\\nsymptoms include\\nprevalence\\nthe condition is thought to be uncommon it usually occurs in young adults but children can be affected too\\ncause\\nthe essential cause of srus is thought to be related to too much straining during defecation\\noveractivity of the anal sphincter during defecation causes the patient to require more effort to expel stool this pressure is produced by the modified valsalva manovoure attempted forced exhalation against a closed glottis resulting in increased abdominal and intrarectal pressure patiest with srus were shown to have higher intrarectal pressures when straining than healthy controls srus is also associated with prolonged and incomplete evacuation of stool\\nmore effort is required because of concomitant anismus or nonrelaxationparadoxical contraction of puborectalis which should normally relax during defecation the increased pressure forces the anterior rectal lining against the contracted puborectalis and frequently the lining prolapses into the anal canal during straining and then returns to its normal position afterwards\\nthe repeated trapping of the lining can cause the tissue to become swollen and congested ulceration is thought to be caused by resulting poor blood supply ischemia combined with repeated frictional trauma from the prolapsing lining and exposure to increased pressure are thought to cause ulceration trauma from hard stools may also contribute\\nthe site of the ulcer is typically on the anterior wall of the rectal ampulla about 710\\xa0cm from the anus however the area may of ulceration may be closer to the anus deeper inside or on the lateral or posterior rectal walls the name solitary can be misleading since there may be more than one ulcer present furthermore there is a preulcerative phase where there is no ulcer at all\\npathological specimens of sections of rectal wall taken from srus patients show thickening and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue and excess collagen rarely srus can present as polyps in the rectum\\nsrus is therefore associated and with internal and more rarely external rectal prolapse some believe that srus represents a spectrum of different diseases with different causes\\nanother condition associated with internal intussusception is colitis cystica profunda also known as ccp or proctitis cystica profunda which is cystica profunda in the rectum cystica profunda is characterized by formation of mucin cysts in the muscle layers of the gut lining and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract when it occurs in the rectum some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with srus since the histologic features of the conditions overlap indeed ccp is managed identically to srus\\nelectromyography may show pudendal nerve motor latency\\ncomplications\\ncomplications are uncommon but include massive rectal bleeding ulceration into the prostate gland or formation of a stricture very rarely cancer can arise on the section of prolapsed rectal lining\\ndiagnosis and investigations\\nsrus is commonly misdiagnosed and the diagnosis is not made for 57 years clinicians may not be familiar with the condition and treat for inflammatory bowel disease or simple constipation\\nthe thickened lining or ulceration can also be mistaken for types of cancer\\nthe differential diagnosis of srus and ccp includes\\ndefecography sigmoidoscopy transrectal ultrasound mucosal biopsy anorectal manometry and electromyography have all been used to diagnose and study srus some recommend biopsy as essential for diagnosis since ulcerations may not always be present and others state defecography as the investigation of choice to diagnose srus\\ntreatment\\nalthough srus is not a medically serious disease it can be the cause of significantly reduced quality of life for patients it is difficult to treat and treatment is aimed at minimizing symptoms\\nstopping straining during bowel movements by use of correct posture dietary fiber intake possibly included bulk forming laxatives such as psyllium stool softeners eg polyethylene glycol and biofeedback retraining to coordinate pelvic floor during defecation\\nsurgery may be considered but only if non surgical treatment has failed and the symptoms are severe enough to warrant the intervention improvement with surgery is about 5560\\nulceration may persist even when symptoms resolve\\nmucosal prolapse syndrome\\na group of conditions known as mucosal prolapse syndrome mps has now been recognized it includes srus rectal prolapse proctitis cystica profunda and inflammatory polyps it is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder the unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse whether internal intussusception occult prolapse or external prolapse\\nepidemiology\\nrectal prolapse affects less than 05 of the general population it affects women more commonly with a female to male ratio of 91\\npornography\\nrosebud pornography and prolapse pornography or rosebudding or rectal prolapse pornography is an anal sex practice that occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornographic actor or actress performs a rectal prolapse wherein the walls of the rectum slip out of the anus rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional however in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately michelle lhooq writing for vice argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making extreme content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet she also argues that rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences\\nterminology\\nprolapse refers to the falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position or relations it is derived from the latin pro  forward  labi  to slide prolapse can refer to many different medical conditions other than rectal prolapse\\nprocidentia has a similar meaning to prolapse referring to a sinking or prolapse of an organ or part it is derived from the latin procidere  to fall forward procidentia usually refers to uterine prolapse but rectal procidentia can also be a synonym for rectal prolapse\\nintussusception is defined as invagination infolding especially referring to the slipping of a length of intestine into an adjacent portion it is derived from the latin intus  within and susceptio  action of undertaking from suscipere  to take up rectal intussusception is not to be confused with other intussusceptions involving colon or small intestine which can sometimes be a medical emergency rectal intussusception by contrast is not lifethreatening\\nintussusceptum refers to the proximal section of rectal wall which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum termed the intussuscipiens what results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlaid from the lumen outwards the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum the middle is the wall of the intussusceptum folded back on itself and the outer is the distal rectal wall the intussuscipiens'}, {'title': 'Hookworm_infection', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'hookworm infection is an infection by a type of intestinal parasite known as a hookworm initially itching and a rash may occur at the site of infection those only affected by a few worms may show no symptoms those infected by many worms may experience abdominal pain diarrhea weight loss and tiredness the mental and physical development of children may be affected anemia may result\\ntwo common hookworm infections in humans are ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis caused by the species ancylostoma duodenale and necator americanus respectively hookworm eggs are deposited in the stools of infected people if these end up in the environment they can hatch into larvae immature worms which can then penetrate the skin one type can also be spread through contaminated food risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates where sanitation is poor diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope\\nthe disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common at a population level decreasing outdoor defecation not using raw feces as fertilizer and mass deworming is effective treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia\\nhookworms infected about 428 million people in 2015 heavy infections can occur in both children and adults but are less common in adults they are rarely fatal hookworm infection is a soiltransmitted helminthiasis and classified as a neglected tropical disease\\nsigns and symptoms\\nno symptoms or signs are specific for hookworm infection but they give rise to a combination of intestinal inflammation and progressive irondeficiency anemia and protein deficiency coughing chest pain wheezing and fever sometimes result from severe infection epigastric pains indigestion nausea vomiting constipation and diarrhea can occur early or in later stages as well although gastrointestinal symptoms tend to improve with time signs of advanced severe infection are those of anemia and protein deficiency including emaciation cardiac failure and abdominal distension with ascites\\nlarval invasion of the skin mostly in the americas can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption the hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin where they give rise to intense local itching usually on the foot or lower leg known as ground itch this infection is due to larvae from the a braziliense hookworm the larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin causing serpiginous vesicular lesions with advancing movement of the larvae the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty the lesions are typically intensely itchy\\nincubation period\\nthe incubation period can vary between a few weeks to many months and is largely dependent on the number of hookworm parasites an individual is infected with\\ncause\\nhookworm infections in humans include ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis ancylostomiasis is caused by ancylostoma duodenale which is the more common type found in the middle east north africa india and formerly in southern europe necatoriasis is caused by necator americanus the more common type in the americas subsaharan africa southeast asia china and indonesia\\nother animals such as birds dogs and cats may also be affected a tubaeforme infects cats a caninum infects dogs and a braziliense and uncinaria stenocephala infect both cats and dogs some of these infections can be transmitted to humans\\nmorphology\\na duodenale worms are grayish white or pinkish with the head slightly bent in relation to the rest of the body this bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named they possess welldeveloped mouths with two pairs of teeth while males measure approximately one centimeter by 05 millimeter the females are often longer and stouter additionally males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa\\nn americanus is very similar in morphology to a duodenale n americanus is generally smaller than a duodenale with males usually 5 to 9\\xa0mm long and females about 1\\xa0cm long whereas a duodenale possesses two pairs of teeth n americanus possesses a pair of cutting plates in the buccal capsule additionally the hook shape is much more defined in necator than in ancylostoma\\nlife cycle\\nthe hookworm thrives in warm soil where temperatures are over 18\\xa0c they exist primarily in sandy or loamy soil and cannot live in clay or muck rainfall averages must be more than 1000\\xa0mm 40\\xa0inches a year for them to survive only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch infective larvae of n americanus can survive at higher temperatures whereas those of a duodenale are better adapted to cooler climates generally they live for only a few weeks at most under natural conditions and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation\\ninfection of the host is by the larvae not the eggs while a duodenale can be ingested the usual method of infection is through the skin this is commonly caused by walking barefoot through areas contaminated with fecal matter the larvae are able to penetrate the skin of the foot and once inside the body they migrate through the vascular system to the lungs and from there up the trachea and are swallowed they then pass down the esophagus and enter the digestive system finishing their journey in the intestine where the larvae mature into adult worms\\nonce in the host gut necator tends to cause a prolonged infection generally 1 to 5 years many worms die within a year or two of infecting though some adult worms have been recorded to live for 15 years or more ancylostoma adults are shortlived surviving on average for only about 6 months however the infection can be prolonged because dormant larvae can be recruited sequentially from tissue stores see pathology above over many years to replace expired adult worms this can give rise to seasonal fluctuations in infection prevalence and intensity apart from normal seasonal variations in transmission\\nthey mate inside the host females laying up to 30000 eggs per day and some 18 to 54 million eggs during their lifetimes which pass out in feces because 5 to 7 weeks are needed for adult worms to mature mate and produce eggs in the early stages of very heavy infection acute symptoms might occur without any eggs being detected in the patients feces this can make diagnosis very difficult\\nn americanus and a duodenale eggs can be found in warm moist soil where they eventually hatch into firststage larvae or l1 l1 the feeding noninfective rhabditoform stage will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into secondstage larvae l2 which is also in the rhabditoform stage it will feed for about 7 days and then molt into the thirdstage larvae or l3 this is the filariform stage of the parasite that is the nonfeeding infective form of the larvae the l3 larvae are extremely motile and seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host the l3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host while n americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin a duodenale can infect both through penetration and orally after the l3 larvae have successfully entered the host they then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host eventually the l3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli they then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host after being swallowed the l3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the l4 or adult worm stage the entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 59 weeks the female adult worms release eggs n americanus about 900010000 eggsday and a duodenale 2500030000 eggsday which are passed in the feces of the human host these eggs hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle starts anew\\npathophysiology\\nhookworm infection is generally considered to be asymptomatic but as norman stoll described in 1962 it is an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is silent and insidious an individual may experience general symptoms soon after infection grounditch which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry is common in patients infected with n americanus additionally cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort however the silent and insidious symptoms referred to by stoll are related to chronic heavyintensity hookworm infections major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss iron deficiency anemia and protein malnutrition they result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood rupturing erythrocytes and degrading hemoglobin in the host this longterm blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworminfected patients recently more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health it is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments additionally recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternalfetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy\\nthe disease was linked to nematode worms ankylostoma duodenalis from onethird to half an inch long in the intestine chiefly through the labours of theodor bilharz and griesinger in egypt 1854\\nthe symptoms can be linked to inflammation in the gut stimulated by feeding hookworms such as nausea abdominal pain and intermittent diarrhea and to progressive anemia in prolonged disease capricious appetite pica or dirteating obstinate constipation followed by diarrhea palpitations thready pulse coldness of the skin pallor of the mucous membranes fatigue and weakness shortness of breath and in cases running a fatal course dysentery hemorrhages and edema the worms suck blood and damage the mucosa however the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent\\nblood tests in early infection often show a rise in numbers of eosinophils a type of white blood cell that is preferentially stimulated by worm infections in tissues large numbers of eosinophils are also present in the local inflammatory response falling blood hemoglobin levels will be seen in cases of prolonged infection with anemia\\nin contrast to most intestinal helminthiases where the heaviest parasitic loads tend to occur in children hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males the explanation for this is that hookworm infection tends to be occupational so that coworkers and other close groups maintain a high prevalence of infection among themselves by contaminating their work environment however in most endemic areas adult women are the most severely affected by anemia mainly because they have much higher physiological needs for iron menstruation repeated pregnancyan interesting consequence of this in the case of ancylostoma duodenale infection is translactational transmission of infection the skininvasive larvae of this species do not all immediately pass through the lungs and on into the gut but spread around the body via the circulation to become dormant inside muscle fibers in a pregnant woman after childbirth some or all of these larvae are stimulated to reenter the circulation presumably by sudden hormonal changes then to pass into the mammary glands so that the newborn baby can receive a large dose of infective larvae through its mothers milk this accounts for otherwise inexplicable cases of very heavy even fatal hookworm infections in children a month or so of age in places such as china india and northern australia\\nan identical phenomenon is much more commonly seen with ancylostoma caninum infections in dogs where the newborn pups can even die of hemorrhaging from their intestines caused by massive numbers of feeding hookworms this also reflects the close evolutionary link between the human and canine parasites which probably have a common ancestor dating back to when humans and dogs first started living closely together\\nfilariform larvae is the infective stage of the parasite infection occurs when larvae in soil penetrate the skin or when they are ingested through contaminated food and water following skin penetration\\ndiagnosis\\ndiagnosis depends on finding characteristic worm eggs on microscopic examination of the stools although this is not possible in early infection early signs of infection in most dogs include limbular limping and anal itching the eggs are oval or elliptical measuring 60 by 40\\xa0m colorless not bile stained and with a thin transparent hyaline shell membrane when released by the worm in the intestine the egg contains an unsegmented ovum during its passage down the intestine the ovum develops and thus the eggs passed in feces have a segmented ovum usually with 4 to 8 blastomeres\\nas the eggs of both ancylostoma and necator and most other hookworm species are indistinguishable to identify the genus they must be cultured in the lab to allow larvae to hatch out if the fecal sample is left for a day or more under tropical conditions the larvae will have hatched out so eggs might no longer be evident in such a case it is essential to distinguish hookworms from strongyloides larvae as infection with the latter has more serious implications and requires different management the larvae of the two hookworm species can also be distinguished microscopically although this would not be done routinely but usually for research purposes adult worms are rarely seen except via endoscopy surgery or autopsy but if found would allow definitive identification of the species classification can be performed based on the length of the buccal cavity the space between the oral opening and the esophagus hookworm rhabditoform larvae have long buccal cavities whereas strongyloides rhabditoform larvae have short buccal cavities\\nrecent research has focused on the development of dnabased tools for diagnosis of infection specific identification of hookworm and analysis of genetic variability within hookworm populations because hookworm eggs are often indistinguishable from other parasitic eggs pcr assays could serve as a molecular approach for accurate diagnosis of hookworm in the feces\\nprevention\\nthe infective larvae develop and survive in an environment of damp dirt particularly sandy and loamy soil they cannot survive in clay or muck the main lines of precaution are those dictated by good hygiene behaviors\\nmoxidectin is available in the united states as imidacloprid  moxidectin topical solution for dogs and cats it utilizes moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms hookworms heartworms and whipworms\\nchildren\\nmost of these public health concerns have focused on children who are infected with hookworm this focus on children is largely due to the large body of evidence that has demonstrated strong associations between hookworm infection and impaired learning increased absences from school and decreased future economic productivity in 2001 the 54th world health assembly passed a resolution demanding member states to attain a minimum target of regular deworming of at least 75 of all atrisk school children by the year 2010 a 2008 world health organization publication reported on these efforts to treat atrisk school children some of the interesting statistics were as follows 1 only 9 out of 130 endemic countries were able to reach the 75 target goal and 2 less than 77 million schoolaged children of the total 878 million at risk were reached which means that only 878 of atrisk children are being treated for hookworm infection\\nschoolbased mass deworming\\nschoolbased mass deworming programs have been the most popular strategy to address the issue of hookworm infection in children schoolbased programs are extremely costeffective as schools already have an available extensive and sustained infrastructure with a skilled workforce that has a close relationship with the community with little training from a local health system teachers can easily administer the drugs which often cost less than us050 per child per year\\nrecently many people have begun to question if the schoolbased programs are necessarily the most effective approach an important concern with schoolbased programs is that they often do not reach children who do not attend school thus ignoring a large number of atrisk children a 2008 study by massa et al continued the debate regarding schoolbased programs they examined the effects of communitydirected treatments versus schoolbased treatments in the tanga region of tanzania a major conclusion was that the mean infection intensity of hookworm was significantly lower in the villages employing the communitydirected treatment approach than the schoolbased approach the communitydirected treatment model used in this specific study allowed villagers to take control of the childs treatment by having villagers select their own community drug distributors to administer the antihelminthic drugs additionally villagers organized and implemented their own methods for distributing the drugs to all children the positive results associated with this new model highlight the need for largescale community involvement in deworming campaigns\\npublic health education\\nmany mass deworming programs also combine their efforts with a public health education these health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as washing your hands before eating and staying away from waterareas contaminated by human feces these programs may also stress that shoes must be worn however these come with their own health risks and may not be effective shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs and the levels of education within that society the wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions such as areas between the toes\\nsanitation\\nhistorical examples such as the hookworm campaigns in mississippi and florida from 1943 to 1947 have shown that the primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets but while these may seem like simple tasks they raise important public health challenges most infected populations are from povertystricken areas with very poor sanitation thus it is most likely that atrisk children do not have access to clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure health education therefore must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resourcelimited settings\\nintegrated approaches\\nevaluation of numerous public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty for example sanitation health education and underlying nutrition status often have minimal impact on transmission for example one study found that the introduction of latrines into a resourcelimited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent however another study in salvador brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection this seems to suggest that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms it is imperative therefore that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education sanitation and treatment\\ntreatment\\nanthelmintic drugs\\nthe most common treatment for hookworm are benzimidazoles specifically albendazole and mebendazole bzas kill adult worms by binding to the nematodes tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite in certain circumstances levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used a 2008 review found that the efficacy of singledose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows 72 for albendazole 15 for mebendazole and 31 for pyrantel pamoate this substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections also of note is that the world health organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester it is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate 200\\xa0mg be administered three times daily at the same time as anthelmintic treatment this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months\\nhookworm infection can be treated with local cryotherapy when the hookworm is still in the skin\\nalbendazole is effective both in the intestinal stage and during the stage the parasite is still migrating under the skin\\nin case of anemia iron supplementation can cause relief symptoms of iron deficiency anemia however as red blood cell levels are restored shortage of other essentials such as folic acid or vitamin b12 may develop so these might also be supplemented\\nduring the 1910s common treatments for hookworm included thymol 2naphthol chloroform gasoline and eucalyptus oil by the 1940s the treatment of choice used tetrachloroethylene given as 3 to 4 cc in the fasting state followed by 30 to 45 g of sodium sulfate tetrachloroethylene was reported to have a cure rate of 80 percent for necator infections but 25 percent in ancylostoma infections and often produced mild intoxication in the patient\\nreinfection and drug resistance\\nother important issues related to the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance it has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high some studies even show that 80 of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 3036 months while reinfection may occur it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes there are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance drug resistance has appeared in frontline anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times less frequent treatment and more targeted treatment nonetheless the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the latestage development\\nepidemiology\\nit is estimated that between 576 and 740 million individuals are infected with hookworm of these infected individuals about 80 million are severely affected the major cause of hookworm infection is n americanus which is found in the americas subsaharan africa and asia a duodenale is found in more scattered focal environments namely europe and the mediterranean most infected individuals are concentrated in subsaharan africa and east asiathe pacific islands with each region having estimates of 198 million and 149 million infected individuals respectively other affected regions include south asia 50 million latin america and the caribbean 50 million south asia 59 million middle eastnorth africa 10 million a majority of these infected individuals live in povertystricken areas with poor sanitation hookworm infection is most concentrated among the worlds poorest who live on less than 2 a day\\nwhile hookworm infection may not directly lead to mortality its effects on morbidity demand immediate attention when considering disabilityadjusted life years dalys neglected tropical diseases including hookworm infection rank among diarrheal diseases ischemic heart disease malaria and tuberculosis as one of the most important health problems of the developing world\\nit has been estimated that as many as 221 million dalys have been lost due to hookworm infection recently there has been increasing interest to address the public health concerns associated with hookworm infection for example the bill amp melinda gates foundation recently donated us34 million to fight neglected tropical diseases including hookworm infection former us president clinton also announced a megacommitment at the clinton global initiative cgi 2008 annual meeting to deworm 10 million children\\nmany of the numbers regarding the prevalence of hookworm infection are estimates as there is no international surveillance mechanism currently in place to determine prevalence and global distribution some prevalence rates have been measured through survey data in endemic regions around the world the following are some of the most recent findings on prevalence rates in regions endemic with hookworm\\ndarjeeling hooghly district west bengal india pal et al 2007\\nxiulongkan village hainan province china gandhi et al 2001\\nha bnh northwest vietnam verle et al 2003\\nminas gerais brazil fleming et al 2006\\nkwazulunatal south africa mabaso et al 2004\\nlowndes county alabama united states \\nthere have also been technological developments that may facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems gis and remote sensing rs to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology brooker et al utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of subsaharan africa by relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from schoolbased surveys they were able to create detailed prevalence maps the study focused on a wide range of helminths but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found as compared to other helminths hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range\\nimproved molecular diagnostic tools are another technological advancement that could help improve existing prevalence statistics recent research has focused on the development of a dnabased tool that can be used for diagnosis of infection specific identification of hookworm and analysis of genetic variability in hookworm populations again this can serve as a major tool for different public health measures against hookworm infection most research regarding diagnostic tools is now focused on the creation of a rapid and costeffective assay for the specific diagnosis of hookworm infection many are hopeful that its development can be achieved within the next five years\\nhistory\\ndiscovery\\nthe symptoms now attributed to hookworm appear in papyrus papers of ancient egypt c 1500 bc described as a derangement characterized by anemia avicenna a persian physician of the eleventh century discovered the worm in several of his patients and related it to their disease in later times the condition was noticeably prevalent in the mining industry in england france germany belgium north queensland and elsewhere\\nitalian physician angelo dubini was the modernday discoverer of the worm in 1838 after an autopsy of a peasant woman dubini published details in 1843 and identified the species as a duodenale working in the egyptian medical system in 1852 german physician theodor bilharz drawing upon the work of colleague wilhelm griesinger found these worms during autopsies and went a step further in linking them to local endemic occurrences of chlorosis which would probably be called iron deficiency anemia today\\na breakthrough came 25 years later following a diarrhea and anemia epidemic that took place among italian workmen employed on the gotthard rail tunnel in an 1880 paper physicians camillo bozzolo edoardo perroncito and luigi pagliani correctly hypothesized that hookworm was linked to the fact that workers had to defecate inside the 15\\xa0km tunnel and that many wore wornout shoes the work environment often contained standing water sometimes kneedeep and the larvae were capable of surviving several weeks in the water allowing them to infect many of the workers in 1897 it was established that the skin was the principal avenue of infection and the biological life cycle of the hookworm was clarified\\neradication programmes\\nin 1899 american zoologist charles wardell stiles identified progressive pernicious anemia seen in the southern united states as being caused by the hookworm a duodenale testing in the 1900s revealed very heavy infestations in schoolage children in puerto rico dr bailey k ashford a us army physician organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign which cured approximately 300000 people onethird of the puerto rican population and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent during the years 190304\\non october 26 1909 the rockefeller sanitary commission for the eradication of hookworm disease was organized as a result of a gift of us1 million from john d rockefeller sr the fiveyear program was a remarkable success and a great contribution to the united states public health instilling public education medication field work and modern government health departments in eleven southern states\\nthe hookworm exhibit was a prominent part of the 1910 mississippi state fair\\nthe commission found that an average of 40 of schoolaged children were infected with hookworm areas with higher levels of hookworm infection prior to the eradication program experienced greater increases in school enrollment attendance and literacy after the intervention econometric studies have shown that this effect cannot be explained by a variety of alternative factors including differential trends across areas changing crop prices shifts in certain educational and health policies and the effect of malaria eradication no significant contemporaneous results were found for adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower prior infection rates the program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the rockefeller foundation international health division\\nthe rfs hookworm campaign in mexico showed how science and politics play a role in developing health policies it brought together government officials health officials public health workers rockefeller officials and the community this campaign was launched to eradicate hookworms in mexico although the campaign did not focus on longterm treatments it did set the terms of the relationship between mexico and the rockefeller foundation the scientific knowledge behind this campaign helped shape public health policies improved public health and built a strong relationship between us and mexico\\nin the 1920s hookworm eradication reached the caribbean and latin america where great mortality was reported among people in the west indies towards the end of the 18th century as well as through descriptions sent from brazil and various other tropical and subtropical regions\\ntreatments\\ntreatment in the early 20th century relied on the use of epsom salt to reduce protective mucus followed by thymol to kill the worms by the 1940s tetrachloroethylene was the leading method it was not until later in the mid20th century when new organic drug compounds were developed\\nresearch\\nanemia in pregnancy\\nit is estimated that a third of all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm 56 of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia 20 of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookwormrelated anemia during pregnancy with the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of childbearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment the world health organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester regardless of these suggestions only madagascar nepal and sri lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs\\nthis lack of deworming of pregnant women is explained by the fact that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes but a 2006 study by gyorkos et al found that when comparing a group of pregnant women treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes the treated group demonstrated 56 adverse birth outcomes while the control group had 625 adverse birth outcomes furthermore larocque et al illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant this study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy\\na review found that a single dose of antihelminthics antiworm drugs given in the second trimester of pregnancy may reduce maternal anaemia and worm prevalence when used in settings with high prevalence of maternal helminthiasis\\nmalaria coinfection\\ncoinfection with hookworm and plasmodium falciparum is common in africa although exact numbers are unknown preliminary analyses estimate that as many as a quarter of african schoolchildren 178321 million children aged 514 years may be coincidentally atrisk of both p falciparum and hookworm while original hypotheses stated that coinfection with multiple parasites would impair the hosts immune response to a single parasite and increase susceptibility to clinical disease studies have yielded contrasting results for example one study in senegal showed that the risk of clinical malaria infection was increased in helminthinfected children in comparison to helminthfree children while other studies have failed to reproduce such results and even among laboratory mouse experiments the effect of helminths on malaria is variable\\nsome hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines responses furthermore the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown for example helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased thelper cell type 2 th2 cytokine and immunoglobulin eige production however the effect of such responses on the human immune response is unknown additionally both malaria and helminth infection can cause anemia but the effect of coinfection and possible enhancement of anemia is poorly understood\\nhygiene hypothesis and hookworm as therapy\\nthe hygiene hypothesis states that infants and children who lack exposure to infectious agents are more susceptible to allergic diseases via modulation of immune system development the theory was first proposed by david p strachan who noted that hay fever and eczema were less common in children who belonged to large families since then studies have noted the effect of gastrointestinal worms on the development of allergies in the developing world for example a study in gambia found that eradication of worms in some villages led to increased skin reactions to allergies among children\\nvaccines\\nwhile annual or semiannual mass antihelminthic administration is a critical aspect of any public health intervention many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty high rates of reinfection and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use current research therefore has focused on the development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs the goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity a vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still have a significant impact on the high burden of disease throughout the world\\ncurrent research focuses on targeting two stages in the development of the worm the larval stage and the adult stage research on larval antigens has focused on proteins that are members of the pathogenesisrelated protein superfamily ancylostoma secreted proteins although they were first described in anyclostoma these proteins have also been successfully isolated from the secreted product of n americanus n americanus asp2 naasp2 is currently the leading larvalstage hookworm vaccine candidate a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study has already been performed 36 healthy adults without a history of hookworm infection were given three intramuscular injections of three different concentrations of naasp2 and observed for six months after the final vaccination the vaccine induced significant antinaasp2 igg and cellular immune responses in addition it was safe and produced no debilitating side effects the vaccine is now in a phase one trial healthy adult volunteers with documented evidence of previous infection in brazil are being given the same dose concentration on the same schedule used in the initial study if this study is successful the next step would be to conduct a phase two trial to assess the rate and intensity of hookworm infection among vaccinated persons because the naasp2 vaccine only targets the larval stage it is critical that all subjects enrolled in the study be treated with antihelminthic drugs to eliminate adult worms prior to vaccination\\nadult hookworm antigens have also been identified as potential candidates for vaccines when adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa of the human host erythrocytes are ruptured in the worms digestive tract which causes the release of free hemoglobin which is subsequently degraded by a proteolytic cascade several of these proteins that are responsible for this proteolytic cascade are also essential for the worms nutrition and survival therefore a vaccine that could induce antibodies for these antigens could interfere with the hookworms digestive pathway and impair the worms survival three proteins have been identified the aspartic proteasehemoglobinase apr1 the cysteine proteasehemoglobinase cp2 and a glutathione stransferase\\n vaccination with apr1 and cp2 led to reduced host blood loss and fecal egg counts in dogs with apr1 vaccination even led to reduced worm burden research is currently stymied at the development of at least one of these antigens as a recombinant protein for testing in clinical trials\\nterminology\\nthe term hookworm is sometimes used to refer to hookworm infection a hookworm is a type of parasitic worm helminth'}, {'title': 'Schizoaffective_disorder', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'schizoaffective disorder sza szd or sad is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal thought processes and an unstable mood the diagnosis is made when the person has symptoms of both schizophrenia usually psychosis and a mood disordereither bipolar disorder or depression the main criterion for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present schizoaffective disorder can often be misdiagnosed when the correct diagnosis may be psychotic depression psychotic bipolar disorder schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia it is imperative for providers to accurately diagnose patients as treatment and prognosis differ greatly for each of these diagnoses\\nthere are two types of schizoaffective disorder the bipolar type which is distinguished by symptoms of mania hypomania or mixed episode and the depressive type which is distinguished by symptoms of depression only common symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations delusions and disorganized speech and thinking auditory hallucinations or hearing voices are most common the onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood on a ranking scale of symptom progression of mental health issues relating to the schizophrenic spectrum a mood disorder would be the first diagnosis as symptoms progress it would then be diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder and if symptoms progress even more it would then be diagnosed as schizophrenia with other disorders included on the ranking as well depending on symptoms a mood disorder would be the less severe diagnoses while schizophrenia would be the more severe diagnosis with schizoaffective disorder being a bridge between the two disorders schizoaffective disorder and other disorders on the schizophrenic spectrum are evaluated as a psychotic disorder in the dsmv so the line between psychotic or not psychotic begins at a mood disorder as being considered not psychotic and schizoaffective disorder along with other disorders of the schizophrenia spectrum as being considered psychotic a mood disorder is not in the schizophrenic spectrum\\ngenetics researched in the field of genomics problems with neural circuits chronic early and chronic or shortterm current environmental stress appear to be important causal factors no single isolated organic cause has been found but extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin bh4 dopamine and glutamic acid in people with schizophrenia psychotic mood disorders and schizoaffective disorder people with schizoaffective disorder are likely to have cooccurring conditions including anxiety disorders and substance use disorders\\nthe mainstay of current treatment is antipsychotic medication combined with mood stabilizer medication or antidepressant medication or both there is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis mania and longterm mood episode cycling in the disorder when there is risk to self or others usually early in treatment hospitalization may be necessary psychiatric rehabilitation psychotherapy and vocational rehabilitation are very important for recovery of higher psychosocial function as a group people with schizoaffective disorder that were diagnosed using dsmiv and icd10 criteria which have since been updated have a better outcome but have variable individual psychosocial functional outcomes compared to people with mood disorders from worse to the same outcomes for people with dsm5 diagnosed schizoaffective disorder depend on data from prospective cohort studies which have not been completed yet the dsm5 diagnosis was updated because dsmiv criteria resulted in overuse of the diagnosis that is dsmiv criteria led to many patients being misdiagnosed with the disorder dsmiv prevalence estimates were less than one percent of the population in the range of 0508 percent newer dsm5 prevalence estimates are not yet available\\nsigns and symptoms\\nschizoaffective disorder is defined by mood disorderfree psychosis in the context of a longterm psychotic and mood disorder psychosis must meet criterion a for schizophrenia which may include delusions hallucinations disorganized thinking and speech or behavior and negative symptoms both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms for example someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses although auditory hallucinations or hearing voices are the most common negative symptoms include alogia lack of speech blunted affect reduced intensity of outward emotional expression avolition lack of motivation and anhedonia inability to experience pleasure negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis\\nmood symptoms are of mania hypomania mixed episode or depression and tend to be episodic rather than continuous a mixed episode represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood grandiosity inflated selfesteem agitation risktaking behavior decreased need for sleep poor concentration rapid speech and racing thoughts symptoms of depression include low mood apathy changes in appetite or weight disturbances in sleep changes in motor activity fatigue guilt or feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thinking\\ndsm5 states that if a patient only experiences psychotic symptoms during a mood episode their diagnosis is mood disorder with psychotic features and not schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder if the patient experiences psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms for longer than a twoweek period their diagnosis is either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder if mood disorder episodes are present for the majority and residual course of the illness and up until the diagnosis the patient can be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder\\ncauses\\na combination of genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role in the development of schizoaffective disorder\\nviewed broadly then biological and environmental factors interact with a persons genes in ways which may increase or decrease the risk for developing schizoaffective disorder exactly how this happens the biological mechanism is not yet known schizophrenia spectrum disorders of which schizoaffective disorder is a part have been increasingly linked to advanced paternal age at the time of conception a known cause of genetic mutations the physiology of people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder appears to be similar but not identical to that of those diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder however human neurophysiological function in normal brain and mental disorder syndromes is not fully understood\\nsubstance use disorder\\na clear causal connection between substance use and psychotic spectrum disorders including schizoaffective disorder has been difficult to prove in the specific case of cannabis marijuana however evidence supports a link between earlier onset of psychotic illness and cannabis use the more often cannabis is used particularly in early adolescence the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness with frequent use being correlated with double the risk of psychosis and schizoaffective disorder a 2009 yale review stated that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms trigger relapse and have negative consequences on the course of the illness while cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizoaffective disorder by many it remains controversial since not all young people who use cannabis later develop psychosis but those who do use cannabis have an increased odds ratio of about 3 certain drugs can imitate symptoms of schizophrenia which we know has similar symptoms to schizoaffective disorder this is important to note when including that substanceinduced psychosis should be ruled out when diagnosing patients so that patients are not misdiagnosed\\ndiagnosis\\npsychosis as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion so a newonset episode of psychosis cannot be considered to be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known medical causes of psychosis are excluded or ruled out many clinicians improperly perform or entirely miss this step introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis\\nan initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination although no biological laboratory tests exist which confirm schizoaffective disorder biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use medications toxins or poisons surgical complications or other medical illnesses since nonmedical mental health practitioners are not trained to exclude medical causes of psychosis people experiencing psychosis should be referred to an emergency department or hospital\\ndelirium should be ruled out which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness indicating other underlying factors which includes medical illnesses excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure\\nother investigations which may be performed include\\nblood tests are not usually repeated for relapse in people with an established diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder unless there is a specific medical indication these may include serum bsl if olanzapine has previously been prescribed thyroid function if lithium has previously been taken to rule out hypothyroidism liver function tests if chlorpromazine has been prescribed cpk levels to exclude neuroleptic malignant syndrome and a urinalysis and serum toxicology screening if substance use is suspected assessment and treatment may be done on an outpatient basis admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to self or others\\nbecause psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications such as antidepressants adhd stimulant medications and sleep medications prescribed medicationinduced psychosis should be ruled out particularly for firstepisode psychosis this is an essential step to reduce diagnostic error and to evaluate potential medication sources of further patient harm regarding prescribed medication sources of patient harm yale school of medicine professor of psychiatry malcolm b bowers jr md wrote\\nillicit drugs arent the only ones

differential diagnosis be made a mental health clinician will incorporate family history observation of a psychotic persons behavior while the person is experiencing active symptoms to begin a psychiatric differential diagnosis diagnosis also includes selfreported experiences as well as behavioral abnormalities reported by family members friends or significant others mistakes in this stage include\\ndsm5 criteria\\nthe most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder are from the american psychiatric associations diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders5\\nthe dsmiv schizoaffective disorder definition was plagued by problems of being inconsistently or unreliably used on patients when the diagnosis is made it does not stay with most patients over time and it has questionable diagnostic validity that is it does not describe a distinct disorder nor predict any particular outcome these problems have been slightly reduced or modestly improved in the dsm5 according to carpenter\\nwhen psychotic symptoms are confined to an episode of mania or depression with or without mixed features the diagnosis is that of a psychotic mood disorder namely either psychotic bipolar disorder or psychotic major depression only when psychotic states persist in a sustained fashion for two weeks or longer without concurrent affective symptoms is the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia\\nthe second cardinal guideline in the dsm5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is one of timeframe\\ndsm5 requires two episodes of psychosis whereas dsmiv needed only one to qualify for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis as such it is no longer an episode diagnosis the new schizoaffective framework looks at the time from the first episode of psychosis up to the current episode of psychosis rather than only defining a single episode with cooccurring psychotic and mood syndromes specifically one of the episodes of psychosis must last a minimum of two weeks without mood disorder symptoms but the person may be mildly to moderately depressed while psychotic the other period of psychosis requires the overlap of mood disorder symptoms with psychotic symptoms to be conspicuous and last for a greater portion of the disorder\\nthese two changes are intended by the dsm5 workgroup to accomplish two goals\\nif the schizoaffective diagnosis is used less often other diagnoses like psychotic mood disorders and schizophrenia are likely to be used more often but this is hypothetical until realworld data arrive validity problems with the diagnosis remain and await further work in the fields of psychiatric genetics neuroimaging and cognitive science that includes the overlapping fields of cognitive affective and social neuroscience which may change the way schizoaffective disorder is conceptualized and defined in future versions of the dsm and icd\\ntypes\\none of two types of schizoaffective disorder may be noted in a diagnosis based on the mood component of the disorder\\nproblems with dsmiv schizoaffective disorder\\nthe american psychiatric associations dsmiv criteria for schizoaffective disorder persisted for 19 years 19942013 clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the schizoaffective diagnosis too often largely because the criteria were poorly defined ambiguous and hard to use or poorly operationalized poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary exclusions of common causes of psychosis including some prescribed psychiatric medications specialty books written by experts on schizoaffective disorder have existed for over eight years before dsm5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis\\ncarpenter and the dsm5 schizoaffective disorders workgroup analyzed data made available to them in 2009 and reported in may 2013 that\\na recent review of psychotic disorders from large private insurance and medicare databases in the us found that the diagnosis of dsmiv schizoaffective disorder was used for about a third of cases with nonaffective psychotic disorders hence this unreliable and poorly defined diagnosis is clearly overused\\nas stated above the dsmiv schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is very inconsistently used or unreliable a diagnosis is unreliable when several different mental health professionals observing the same individual make different diagnoses excessively even when a structured dsmiv diagnostic interview and best estimate procedures were made by experts in the field that included information from family informants and prior clinical records reliability was still poor for the dsmiv schizoaffective diagnosis\\nthe dsmiv schizoaffective diagnosis is not stable over time either an initial diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder during time spent at a psychiatric inpatient facility was stable at 6month and 24month follow ups for only 36 of patients by comparison diagnostic stability was 92 for schizophrenia 83 for bipolar disorder and 74 for major depression most patients diagnosed with dsmiv schizoaffective disorder are later diagnosed with a different disorder and that disorder is more stable over time than the dsmiv schizoaffective disorder diagnosis\\nin april 2009 carpenter and the dsm5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup reported that they were developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve reliability and face validity and were determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood would justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category speaking to an audience at the may 2009 annual conference of the american psychiatric association carpenter said\\nwe had hoped to get rid of schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category in the dsm5 because we dont think its a valid scientific entity and we dont think its reliable on the other hand we think its absolutely indispensable to clinical practice\\na major reason why dsmiv schizoaffective disorder was indispensable to clinical practice is because it offered clinicians a diagnosis for patients with psychosis in the context of mood disorder whose clinical picture at the time diagnosed appeared different from dsmiv schizophrenia or mood disorder with psychotic features\\nbut dsmiv schizoaffective disorder carries an unnecessarily worse prognosis than a mood disorder with psychotic features diagnosis because longterm data revealed that a significant proportion of dsmiv schizoaffective disorder patients had 15year outcomes indistinguishable from patients with mood disorders with or without psychotic features even though the clinical picture at the time of first diagnosis looked different from both schizophrenia and mood disorders\\nthese problems with the dsmiv schizoaffective disorder definition result in most people the diagnosis is used on being misdiagnosed furthermore outcome studies done 10 years after the diagnosis was released showed that the group of patients defined by the dsmiv and icd10 schizoaffective diagnosis had significantly better outcomes than predicted so the diagnosis carries a misleading and unnecessarily poor prognosis the dsmiv criteria for schizoaffective disorder will continue to be used on us board examinations in psychiatry through the end of 2014 established practitioners may continue to use the problematic dsmiv definition much further into the future also\\ndsm5 research directions\\nthe new schizoaffective disorder criteria continue to have questionable diagnostic validity questionable diagnostic validity does not doubt that people with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder need treatmentpsychosis and mood disorder must be treated instead questionable diagnostic validity means there are unresolved problems with the way the dsm5 categorizes and defines schizoaffective disorder\\na core concept in modern psychiatry since dsmiii was released in 1980 is the categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia known as the kraepelinian dichotomy emil kraepelin introduced the idea that schizophrenia was separate from mood disorders after observing patients with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder over a century ago in 1898 this was a time before genetics were known and before any treatments existed for mental illness the kraepelinian dichotomy was not used for dsmi and dsmii because both manuals were influenced by the dominant psychodynamic psychiatry of the time but the designers of dsmiii wanted to use more scientific and biological definitions consequently they looked to psychiatrys history and decided to use the kraepelinian dichotomy as a foundation for the classification system\\nthe kraepelinian dichotomy continues to be used in dsm5 despite having been challenged by data from modern psychiatric genetics for over eight years and there is now evidence of a significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder according to this genetic evidence the kraepelinian categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia at the foundation of the current classification and diagnostic system is a mistaken false dichotomy\\nthe dichotomy at the foundation of the current system forms the basis for a convoluted schizoaffective disorder definition in dsmiv that resulted in excessive misdiagnosis real life schizoaffective disorder patients have significant and enduring symptoms that bridge what are incorrectly assumed to be categorically separate disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disorder people with psychotic depression bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis and schizophrenia with mood symptoms also have symptoms that bridge psychosis and mood disorders the categorical diagnostic manuals do not reflect reality in their separation of psychosis via the schizophrenia diagnosis from mood disorder nor do they currently emphasize the actual overlap found in reallife patients thus they are likely to continue to introduce eitheror conceptual and diagnostic error by way of confirmation bias into clinicians mindsets hindering accurate assessment and treatment\\nthe new definition continues the lack of parsimony of the old definition simpler clearer and more usable definitions of the diagnosis were supported by certain members of the dsm5 workgroup see next paragraph these were debated but deemed premature because more research is needed to establish a new classification system of equal or greater validity to the existing system because of dsm5s continuing problematic categorical foundation schizoaffective disorders conceptual and diagnostic validity remains doubtful after enough research is completed and data exists future diagnostic advances will need to either eliminate and replace or soften and bridge the hard categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia most likely using a spectrum or dimensional approach to diagnosis\\nmore parsimonious definitions than the current one were considered by carpenter and the dsm5 workgroup\\none option for the dsm5 would have been to remove the schizoaffective disorder category and to add affective or mood symptoms that is mania hypomania mixed episode or depression as a dimension to schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder or to define a single category for the cooccurrence of psychosis and mood symptoms this option was extensively debated but ultimately deemed to be premature in the absence of sufficient clinical and theoretical validating data justifying such a  reconceptualization additionally there appeared to be no practical way to introduce affect or mood dimensions covering the entire course of illness that would capture the current concept of periods of psychosis related and unrelated to mood episodes\\nthe field of psychiatry has begun to question its assumptions and analyze its data in order to merge closer with evidencebased medicine the removal of the episode diagnosis and the addition of two episodes of psychosis as qualifications for the dsm5 schizoaffective diagnosis may improve the diagnosis consistency over dsmiv for research purposes where diagnostic criteria are by necessity followed exactingly but the new definition remains long unwieldy and perhaps still not very useful for community clinicianswith two psychoses one for two weeks minimum and without mood disorder but the person can be mildly or moderately depressed and the other with significant mood disorder and psychosis lasting for most of the time and with lasting mood symptoms for most of the residual portion of the illness community clinicians used the previous definition for about a third of cases with nonaffective psychotic disorders nonaffective psychotic disorders are by definition not schizoaffective disorder for clinicians to make such sizeable errors of misdiagnosis may imply systemic problems with the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis itself already at least one expert believes the new schizoaffective definition has not gone far enough to solve the previous definitions problems\\nfrom a scientific standpoint modern clinical psychiatry is still a very young underdeveloped medical specialty because its target organ the human brain is not yet well understood the human brains neural circuits for example are just beginning to be mapped by modern neuroscience in the human connectome project and clarity clinical psychiatry furthermore has begun to understand and acknowledge its current limitationsbut further steps by the field are required to significantly reduce misdiagnosis and patient harm this is crucial both for responsible patient care and to retain public trust looking forward a paradigm shift is needed in psychiatric research to address unanswered questions about schizoaffective disorder the dimensional research domain criteria project currently being developed by the us national institutes of mental health may be the specific problem solving framework psychiatry needs to develop a more scientifically mature understanding of schizoaffective disorder as well as all other mental disorders\\ntreatment\\nthe primary treatment of schizoaffective disorder is medication with improved outcomes using combined longterm psychological and social supports hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or if mental health legislation allows it involuntarily longterm hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization started in the 1950s although it still occurs community support services including dropin centers visits by members of a community mental health team supported employment and support groups are common evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizoaffective disorder\\nparticipating in internet forums is sometimes used by people with schizoaffective disorder in addition to outpatient medication treatment\\ntherapy\\nskillfully delivered psychosocial treatments are perhaps the most important component of pushing for and encouraging improved overall functioning in schizoaffective disorder supportive psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are both helpful intensive case management icm has been shown to reduce hospitalizations improve adherence to treatment and improve social functioning with icm clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to wellbeing including housing\\nhigh quality psychosocial or psychiatric rehabilitation is very important for recovery from schizoaffective disorder psychiatric or psychosocial rehabilitation focuses on solving community integration problems such as obtaining and keeping housing and increasing involvement in positive social groups it also focuses on improving and increasing activities of daily living increasing daily healthy habits such as normalizing sleepwake cycles increasing early morning natural light exposure increasing moderate exercise such as 2030 minutes of moderate to brisk early morning to preafternoon walking daily in order to help normalize circadian rhythms helping individuals understand the specific benefits of healthy food choices increasing stressreduction activities such as yoga tai chi or meditation and decreasing unhealthy behaviors such as substance use and smoking thereby significantly improving quality of life high quality psychiatric rehabilitation may also focus on vocational rehabilitation including preparing the client for volunteer parttime paid work returning to school for further education job skills training for fulltime flexible or supported employment and other client selfimprovement efforts core principles of effective psychiatric rehabilitation must include providing hope when the client lacks it respect for the client wherever they are in the recovery process empowering the client teaching the client wellness planning and emphasizing the importance for the client to develop social support networks a longterm goal of psychiatric and vocational rehabilitation is that the client learn and actively engage in active stress management while in education or employment while receiving treatment\\npsychiatric rehabilitation consists of eight main areas\\nmedication\\nantipsychotic medication is usually required both for acute treatment and the prevention of relapse there is no single antipsychotic of choice in treating schizoaffective disorder but atypical antipsychotics should be considered because they have moodstabilizing activity paliperidone is an antipsychotic with fda approval for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder antipsychotics should be used at the minimum dose necessary to control symptoms potential side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms including tremor muscle stiffness and restlessness or akathisia atypical antipsychotics carry a risk of metabolic syndrome including weight gain increased blood sugar and increased blood cholesterol so regular monitoring of weight and blood work should be carried out some atypical antipsychotics such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole are associated with less risk than others such as olanzapine medication choice is based on how effectively it reduces symptoms how few side effects it causes and cost\\nin people with treatmentrefractory psychosis a clozapine trial should be considered clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is recognized as being particularly effective when other antipsychotic agents have failed clozapine should also be considered in people with chronic and persistent suicidal thinking and behaviour as it has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide in patients with schizoaffective disorder and a history of suicidality between 05 and 2 of patients taking clozapine may develop a lifethreatening complication called agranulocytosis which is a significant drop in a type of white blood cell because of this risk people taking clozapine must have regular monitoring of blood cell counts\\nthe management of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is similar to the treatment of bipolar disorder with the goal of preventing mood episodes and cycling lithium or anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as valproic acid carbamazepine and lamotrigine are prescribed in combination with an antipsychotic\\nfor depression if an antidepressant is prescribed extra attentiveness must be given by the prescribing clinician due its risk for longterm mood cycle acceleration that is inducing more frequent episodes of depression per unit of time and prescribed medicationinduced psychosis or mania for individuals who show emerging psychosis mania mixed episode symptoms or mood cycle acceleration switching to an antipsychotic plus lithium or lamotrigine is preferable to antidepressants\\nfor individuals who experience anxiety antianxiety medications can be used usually on a shortterm basis benzodiazepines including lorazepam clonazepam and diazepam are types of antianxiety medications care must be taken when prescribing benzodiazepines due to the risk of the person developing tolerance and dependence\\nelectroconvulsive therapy\\nelectroconvulsive therapy ect may be considered for patients with schizoaffective disorder experiencing severe depression or severe psychotic symptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotics\\nepidemiology\\nschizoaffective disorder is estimated to occur in 03 to 08 percent of people at some point in their life 30 of cases occur between the ages of 25 and 35 it is more common in women than men however this is because of the high concentration of women in the depressive subcategory whereas the bipolar subtype has a roughly even gender distribution\\nhistory\\nthe term schizoaffective psychosis was introduced by the american psychiatrist jacob kasanin in 1933 to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms that was thought at the time to be a goodprognosis schizophrenia kasanins concept of the illness was influenced by the psychoanalytic teachings of adolf meyer and kasanin postulated that schizoaffective psychosis was caused by emotional conflicts of a mainly sexual nature and that psychoanalysis would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks he based his description on a case study of nine individuals\\nother psychiatrists before and after kasanin have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic cause of the illness in 1863 german psychiatrist karl kahlbaum 18281899 described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his vesania typica circularis kahlbaum distinguished between crosssectional and longitudinal observations crosssectional refers to observation of a single specific episode of the illness for example one episode of psychotic depression while longitudinal refers to longterm observation of many distinct episodes similar or different often occurring over the span of years in 1920 psychiatrist emil kraepelin 18561926 the founder of contemporary scientific psychiatry observed a great number of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses dementia praecox now called schizophrenia and manic depressive insanity now called bipolar disorders plural since there are more than one type of bipolar disorder and recurrent depression\\nkraepelin acknowledged that there are many overlaps in this area that is the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders in 1959 psychiatrist kurt schneider 18871967 began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed concurrent and sequential types the concurrent type of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis while his sequential type refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes schneider described schizoaffective disorders as cases inbetween the traditional kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders\\nthe historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder specifically recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes and polygenic variations\\nschizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in dsmi and dsmii though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia dsmiii placed schizoaffective disorder in psychotic disorders not otherwise specified before being formally recognized in dsmiiir dsmiiir included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes bipolar and depressive in dsmiv published in 1994 schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category other psychotic disorders and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as dsmiiir with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology\\ndsmiv and dsmivtr published in 2000 criteria for schizoaffective disorder were poorly defined and poorly operationalized these ambiguous and unreliable criteria lasted 19 years and led clinicians to significantly overuse the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis patients commonly diagnosed with dsmiv schizoaffective disorder showed a clinical picture at time of diagnosis that appeared different from schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders using dsmiv criteria but who as a group were longitudinally determined to have outcomes indistinguishable from those with mood disorders with or without psychotic features a poor prognosis was assumed to apply to these patients by most clinicians and this poor prognosis was harmful to many patients the poor prognosis for dsmiv schizoaffective disorder was not based on patient outcomes research but was caused by poorly defined criteria interacting with clinical tradition and belief clinician enculturation with unscientific assumptions from the diagnosis history discussed above including the invalid kraepelinian dichotomy and by clinicians being unfamiliar with the scientific limitations of the diagnostic and classification system\\nthe dsm5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup analyzed all of the available research evidence on schizoaffective disorder and concluded that presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis prognosis or treatment response given our understanding of overlapping genetics in bipolar disorders schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia as well as the overlap in treatments for these disorders but given the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms for determining diagnosis prognosis or treatment response in these psychotic illness syndromes the limits of our knowledge are clearer presenting symptoms of psychosis describe only presenting symptoms to be treated and not much more schizoaffective disorder was changed to a longitudinal or life course diagnosis in dsm5 for this reason\\nresearch\\nevidence is lacking about schizoaffective disorders likely multiple causes and mechanisms knowing these leads to specific and consistently effective treatments and about how exactly mood episodes and psychosis are related knowing this may lead to a simpler clearer and more usable behavioral definition of the disorder as well as a better diagnostic system whether schizoaffective disorder is a variant of schizophrenia as in dsm5 and icd10 classification systems a variant of bipolar disorder or part of a dimensional continuum between psychotic depression bipolar disorders and schizophrenia is currently being investigated\\nresearch into the assessment and treatment of schizoaffective disorder will rely less on dsm and icd criteria as time progresses and more on the dimensional research domain criteria currently being developed by the us national institute of mental health nimh the research domain criteria initiative led by bruce cuthbert of nimh is the inspiration for the roadmap for mental health research in europe roamer the purpose of the research domain criteria initiative is to address the marked variability and overlap within and among the disorder categories and to foster development of more effective assessment and treatment for each individual patient over the coming decades advances resulting from the research domain criteria in the us and roamer in europe will be incorporated into future versions of the dsm and icd with the hope of eventually leading to personalized mental health of greater diagnostic accuracy and with more targeted and useful treatments including biomedical psychosocial and possibly preventive approaches'}, {'title': 'Learning_disability', 'label': 'Disease', 'text': 'learning disability learning disorder or learning difficulty british english is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors given the difficulty learning in a typical manner this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner therefore some people can be more accurately described as having a learning difference thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping in the united kingdom the term learning disability generally refers to an intellectual disability while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as learning difficulties\\nwhile learning disability and learning disorder are often used interchangeably they differ in many ways disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area these problems however are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis learning disability on the other hand is an official clinical diagnosis whereby the individual meets certain criteria as determined by a professional such as a psychologist psychiatrist speech language pathologist or pediatrician the difference is in degree frequency and intensity of reported symptoms and problems and thus the two should not be confused when the term learning disorder is used it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic language and speech skills types of learning disorders include reading dyslexia arithmetic dyscalculia and writing dysgraphia\\nthe unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brains ability to receive and process information this disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability people with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways\\nindividuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan depending on the type and severity of the disability interventions and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success some interventions can be quite simplistic while others are intricate and complex current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports teachers parents and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners a multidisciplinary team frequently helps to design the intervention and to coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents this team frequently includes school psychologists special educators speech therapists pathologists occupational therapists psychologists esl teachers literacy coaches andor reading specialists \\ndefinition\\nrepresentatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as national joint committee on learning disabilities njcld the njcld used the term learning disability to indicate a discrepancy between a childs apparent capacity to learn and their level of achievement several difficulties existed however with the njcld standard of defining learning disability one such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability this conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction such as those with cerebral palsy did not experience disabilities in learning on the other hand those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment planning and instruction the njcld notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions however the two should not be directly linked together or confused\\nin the 1980s njcld therefore defined the term learning disability as a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening speaking reading writing reasoning or mathematical abilities these disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions eg sensory impairment intellectual disability social and emotional disturbance or environmental influences eg cultural differences insufficientinappropriate instruction psychogenic factors it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences\\nthe 2002 ld roundtable produced the following definitionconcept of ld strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities sld this evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies the central concept of sld involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual sld are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes sld may occur in combination with other disabling conditions but they are not due primarily to other conditions such as intellectual disability behavioral disturbance lack of opportunities to learn or primary sensory deficitsthe issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy the term learning disability does not exist in dsmiv but it has been added to the dsm5 the dsm5 does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading mathematics or written expression instead it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading mathematics and written expression\\nunited states and canada\\nin the united states and canada the terms learning disability and learning disorder ld refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to speak listen read write spell reason organize information and do math people with learning disabilities generally have intelligence that is average or higher\\nlegislation in the united states\\nthe section 504 of the rehabilitation act 1973 effective may 1977 guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities especially in the cases of education and work such being in schools colleges and university settings\\nthe individuals with disabilities education act formerly known as the education for all handicapped children act is a united states federal law that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention special education and related services to children with disabilities it addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21 considered as a civil rights law states are not required to participate\\ncanada\\nin canada the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents originally called the association for children with learning disabilities the learning disabilities association of canada  ldac was created to provide awareness and services for individuals with learning disabilities their families at work and the community since education is largely the responsibility of each province and territory in canada provinces and territories have jurisdiction over the education of individuals with learning disabilities which allows the development of policies and support programs that reflect the unique multicultural linguistic and socioeconomic conditions of its area\\nunited kingdom\\nin the uk terms such as specific learning difficulty spld developmental dyslexia developmental coordination disorder and dyscalculia are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the united states as learning disabilities in the uk the term learning disability refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized cognitive impairment the lancet defines learning disability as a significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood and states that roughly one in 50 british adults have one\\njapan\\nin japan acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development and has improved drastically in the last decade the first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999 and in 2001 the enrichment project for the support system for students with learning disabilities was established since then there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities provide followup support and provide networking between schools and specialists\\neffects\\nthe effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label it has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors it seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors it has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance\\nmany studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and selfesteem these studies have shown that an individuals selfesteem is indeed affected by their own awareness of their learning disability students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher selfesteem than those who do not regardless of their actual academic achievement however studies have also shown that several other factors can influence selfesteem skills in nonacademic areas such as athletics and arts improve selfesteem also a positive perception of ones physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of selfesteem another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity this demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals which increases their selfesteem\\nresearch involving individuals with learning disabilities who exhibit challenging behaviors who are subsequently treated with antipsychotic medications provides little evidence that any benefits outweigh the risk\\ncauses\\nthe causes for learning disabilities are not well understood and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability however some causes of neurological impairments include\\n learning disabilities are often linked through genetics and run in the family children who have learning disabilities often have parents who have the same struggles children of parents who had less than 12 years of school are more likely to have a reading disability some children have spontaneous mutations ie not present in either parent which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities one study estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations for example a fault in the cdk13 gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected\\n a learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain illness or injury risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight 3 pounds or less these children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading children who are born prematurely late have a longer labor than usual or have trouble receiving oxygen are more likely to develop a learning disability\\nlearning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries malnutrition or by toxic exposure such as heavy metals or pesticides\\ndiagnosis\\niqachievement discrepancy\\nlearning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists speech language pathologists school psychologists clinical psychologists counseling psychologists neuropsychologists speech language pathologists and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing academic achievement testing classroom performance and social interaction and aptitude other areas of assessment may include perception cognition memory attention and language abilities the resulting information is used to determine whether a childs academic performance is commensurate with their cognitive ability if a childs cognitive ability is much higher than their academic performance the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability the dsmiv and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way dsmiv uses the term disorder rather than disability\\nalthough the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured iq and achievement is a clear indicator of ld furthermore diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with iq ie their iq scores are also low appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with iq ie their iq scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest\\nsince 1998 there have been attempts to create a reference index more useful than iq to generate predicted scores on achievement tests for example for a student whose vocabulary and general knowledge scores matches their reading comprehension score a teacher could assume that reading comprehension can be supported through work in vocabulary and general knowledge if the reading comprehension score is lower in the appropriate statistical sense it would be necessary to first rule out things like vision problems\\nresponse to intervention\\nmuch current research has focused on a treatmentoriented diagnostic process known as response to intervention rti researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students placing those students who are having difficulty into researchbased early intervention programs rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress those who respond will not require further intervention those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction often called tier 1 instruction and a more intensive intervention often called tier 2 intervention are considered nonresponders these students can then be referred for further assistance through special education in which case they are often identified with a learning disability some models of rti include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability\\na primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance this may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure which may in turn result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services in the united states the 2004 reauthorization of the individuals with disabilities education act permitted states and school districts to use rti as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities rti is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in florida\\nthe process does not take into account childrens individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory that can inform design instruction by not taking into account specific cognitive processes rti fails to inform educators about a students relative strengths and weaknesses second rti by design takes considerably longer than established techniques often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention third it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability lastly rti is considered a regular education initiative and consists of members of general education teachers in conjunction with other qualified professionals occupational therapists ots in particular can support students in the educational setting by helping children in academic and nonacademic areas of school including the classroom recess and meal time they can provide strategies therapeutic interventions suggestions for adaptive equipment and environmental modifications ots can work closely with the childs teacher and parents to facilitate educational goals specific to each child under an rti andor iep\\nlatino english language learners\\ndemographers in the united states report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the united states over the past two decades this information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is english it is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in english language learners ell differs in the united states there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations\\ncurrently there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing english language learners ell with specific learning disabilities sld this is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are unable to clearly assess if a students delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability with an unclear diagnosis many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system for example in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with english language learners students were commonly pushed toward testing based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ells growth in language and academically when ells are referred for a psychoeducational assessment it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process from poor quality educational services from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders attention problems and learning disabilities additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the us dealing could be potentially dealing with these factors that include acculturation fear andor worry of deportation separation from social supports such as parents language barriers disruptions in learning experiences stigmatization economic challenge and risk factors associated with poverty in the united states there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population\\nspanishspeaking ell\\na well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool also an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples observations interviews and rating scales as well as curriculumbased measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments a compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ell student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors it is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools also many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ell students\\nassessment\\nmany normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains reading including word recognition fluency and comprehension mathematics including computation and problem solving and written expression including handwriting spelling and composition\\nthe most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the woodcockjohnson iv wj iv wechsler individual achievement test ii wiat ii the wide range achievement test iii wrat iii and the stanford achievement test10th edition these tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty\\nin the reading domain there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include grays diagnostic reading tests2nd edition gdrt ii and the stanford diagnostic reading assessment assessments that measure reading subskills include the gray oral reading test iv\\xa0 fourth edition gort iv gray silent reading test comprehensive test of phonological processing ctopp tests of oral reading and comprehension skills torcs test of reading comprehension 3 torc3 test of word reading efficiency towre and the test of reading fluency a more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the southwest educational development laboratory\\nthe purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated such as behavioral issues or language delays these contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students behaviors and compares them to standardized norms\\nhowever caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia especially as people with downs syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs\\ntypes\\nlearning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit\\nby stage of information processing\\nlearning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning input integration storage and output many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders \\n this is the information perceived through the senses such as visual and auditory perception difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape position or size of items seen there can be problems with sequencing which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them such as the sound of the teachers voice in a classroom setting some children appear to be unable to process tactile input for example they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched\\n this is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted categorized placed in a sequence or related to previous learning students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the big picture a poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension\\n problems with memory can occur with shortterm or working memory or with longterm memory most memory difficulties occur with ones shortterm memory which can make it difficult to learn new material without more repetitions than usual difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell\\n information comes out of the brain either through words that is language output or through muscle activity such as gesturing writing or drawing difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language such difficulties include answering a question on demand in which one must retrieve information from storage organize our thoughts and put the thoughts into words before we speak it can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills people with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy that is they may be prone to stumbling falling or bumping into things they may also have trouble running climbing or learning to ride a bicycle people with fine motor difficulties may have trouble with handwriting buttoning shirts or tying shoelaces\\nby function impaired\\ndeficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities it is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties this is referred to as comorbidity or cooccurrence of learning disabilities in the uk the term dual diagnosis is often used to refer to cooccurrence of learning difficulties\\nreading disorder icd10 and dsmiv codes f81031500\\nreading disorder is the most common learning disability of all students with specific learning disabilities 7080 have deficits in reading the term developmental dyslexia is often used as a synonym for reading disability however many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities of which dyslexia is one a reading disability can affect any part of the reading process including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition or both word decoding reading rate prosody oral reading with expression and reading comprehension before the term dyslexia came to prominence this learning disability used to be known as word blindness\\ncommon indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awarenessthe ability to break up words into their component sounds and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds soundsymbol correspondence\\ndisorder of written expression icd10 and dsmivtr codes 3152\\nthe dsmivtr criteria for a disorder of written expression is writing skills as measured by a standardized test or functional assessment that fall substantially below those expected based on the individuals chronological age measured intelligence and ageappropriate education criterion a this difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text criterion b and if a sensory deficit is present the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit criterion c\\nindividuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences poor paragraph organization multiple spelling errors and excessively poor penmanship a disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis if poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals motor coordination a diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder should be considered\\nby a number of organizations the term dysgraphia has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression\\nmath disability icd10 and dsmiv codes f81233151\\nsometimes called dyscalculia a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts such as quantity place value and time difficulty memorizing math facts difficulty organizing numbers and understanding how problems are organized on the page dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor number sense\\nmanagement\\ninterventions include\\nsternberg has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities he has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an importantyet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities\\nsociety and culture\\nschool laws\\nschools in the united states have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country including undocumented students the landmark supreme court ruling plyler v doe 1982 grants all children no matter their legal status the right to a free education this ruling suggests that as a country we acknowledge that we have a population of students with specific needs that differ from those of native speakers additionally specifically in regards to ells the supreme court ruling lau v nichols 1974 stated that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless this ruling is also supported by english language development services provided in schools but these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider\\ncritique of the medical model\\nlearning disability theory is founded in the medical model of disability in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin researchers working within a social model of disability assert that there are social or structural causes of disability or the assignation of the label of disability and even that disability is entirely socially constructed since the turn of the 19th century education in the united states has been geared toward producing citizens who can effectively contribute to a capitalistic society with a cultural premium on efficiency and science more agrarian cultures for example do not even use learning ability as a measure of adult adequacy whereas the diagnosis of learning disabilities is prevalent in western capitalistic societies because of the high value placed on speed literacy and numeracy in both the labor force and school system\\nculture\\nthere are three patterns that are well known in regards to mainstream students and minority labels in the united states\\nin the present day it has been reported that white districts have more children from minority backgrounds enrolled in special education than they do majority students it was also suggested that districts with a higher percentage of minority faculty had fewer minority students placed in special education suggesting that minority students are treated differently in predominantly white districts than in predominantly minority districts\\neducators have only recently started to look into the effects of culture on learning disabilities if a teacher ignores a students culturally diverse background the student will suffer in the class the cultural repertoires of students from cultural learning disorder backgrounds have an impact on their learning school progress and behavior in the classroom these students may then act out and not excel in the classroom and will therefore be misdiagnosed overall the data indicates that there is a persistent concern regarding the misdiagnosis and inappropriate placement of students from diverse backgrounds in special education classes since the 1975\\nsocial roots of learning disabilities in the us\\nlearning disabilities have a disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low socioeconomic status ses while some attribute the disproportionate identification of racialethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding others have argued that racialethnic minorities are overidentified because of their lower status similarities were noted between the behaviors of braininjured and lower class students as early as the 1960s the distinction between raceethnicity and ses is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need\\nwhile many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time or used district or schoollevel data to examine this issue more recent studies have used large national studentlevel datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of african american students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower ses while the disproportionate identification of latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously for instance if high ses minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high ses whites and low ses minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low ses whites we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low ses summarily because the risk of identification for white students who have low ses is similar to that of black students who have low ses future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low ses youth that lead to their disproportionate identification rather than focusing exclusively on racialethnic minorities it remains to be determined why lower ses youth are at higher risk of incidence or possibly just of identification with learning disabilities\\nlearning disabilities in adulthood\\na common misconception about those with learning disabilities is that they outgrow it as they enter adulthood this is often not the case and most adults with learning disabilities still require resources and care to help manage their disability one resource available is the adult basic education abe programs at the state level abe programs are allotted certain amounts of funds per state in order to provide resources for adults with learning disabilities this includes resources to help them learn basic life skills in order to provide for themselves abe programs also provide help for adults who lack a high school diploma or an equivalent these programs teach skills to help adults get into the workforce or into a further level of education there is a certain pathway that these adults and instructors should follow in order to ensure these adults have the abilities needed to succeed in life some abe programs offer ged preparation programs to support adults through the process to get a ged it is important to note that abe programs do not always have the expected outcome on things like employment participants in abe programs are given tools to help them succeed and get a job but employment is dependent on more than just a guarantee of a job postabe employment varies based on the level of growth a participant experiences in an abe program the personality and behavior of the participant and the job market they are entering into following completion of an abe program \\nanother program to assist adults with disabilities are federal programs called home and community based services hcbs medicaid funds these programs for many people through a fee waiver system however there are still lots of people on a standby list these programs are primarily used for adults with autism spectrum disorders hcbs programs offer service more dedicated to caring for the adult not so much providing resources for them to transition into the workforce some services provided are therapy social skills training support groups and counseling \\ncontrast with other conditions\\npeople with an iq lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an intellectual disability and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence\\nattentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder adhd is often studied in connection with learning disabilities but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities individuals with adhd may struggle with learning but can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the adhd a person can have adhd but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having adhd the conditions can cooccur\\npeople diagnosed with adhd sometimes have impaired learning some of the struggles people with adhd have might include lack of motivation high levels of anxiety and the inability to process information there are studies that suggest people with adhd generally have a positive attitude toward academics and with developed study skills can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities also using alternate sources of gathering information such as websites study groups and learning centers can help a person with adhd be academically successful\\nsome research is beginning to make a case for adhd being included in the definition of lds since it is being shown to have a strong effect on executive functions required for learning this has not as yet affected any official definitions though historically adhd was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning scientific research continues to explore the traits struggles and learning styles of those with adhd'}]\n",
